Contacts
========

Contacts are created in the **Contacts** application for customers the company does business with
through Odoo. A contact record is a repository of vital business information, facilitating
communication and business transactions.

Contact form
============

To create a new contact, navigate to the :menuselection:`Contacts app`, and click :guilabel:`New`. A
new form appears where various contact information can be added.

Contact type
------------

Odoo supports both :guilabel:`Person` and :guilabel:`Company` contacts. Select the appropriate type
for the new contact. Fill in the name of the :guilabel:`Person` or :guilabel:`Company`. This is how
the name appears throughout the database. This field is **mandatory**.

.. tip::
   :guilabel:`Person` contacts can be linked to a :guilabel:`Company` contact. After selecting
   :guilabel:`Person`, the :guilabel:`Company` field becomes visible.

In the :icon:`fa-envelope` :guilabel:`(envelope)` field, enter the email address with the domain. In
the :icon:`fa-phone` :guilabel:`(phone)`  field enter the phone number with the appropriate country
code. Next, enter the :guilabel:`Address` of the :guilabel:`Company` or :guilabel:`Person`.

Additional fields
-----------------

Additional details are included on the initial form. The following fields are available:

- :guilabel:`Job Position`: list the job position of the :guilabel:`Person` (only available on
  :guilabel:`Person`).
- :guilabel:`Tax ID`: the identification number used for tax and accounting purposes.
- :guilabel:`Partner Level`: select the designated :ref:`partner <contacts/partner-assignment>`
  level for this contact from the drop-down menu.
- :guilabel:`Website`: enter the full website address, starting with `http` or `https`.
- :guilabel:`Language`: enter the language used by the contact. All of the emails and documents sent
  to this contact are then translated to the selected language.
- :guilabel:`Tags`: enter preconfigured tags by typing them in the field, or clicking the drop-down
  menu, and selecting one. To create a new one, type the new tag in the field, and click
  :guilabel:`Create` from the resulting drop-down menu.

Contacts tab
------------

On the :guilabel:`Contacts` tab, contacts can be added that are associated with a
:guilabel:`Company` and related addresses. For example, a specific contact person for the company
can be listed here.

Multiple addresses can be added on both :guilabel:`Person` and :guilabel:`Company` contacts. To do
so, click :guilabel:`Add Contact` in the :guilabel:`Contacts` tab. Doing so reveals a
:guilabel:`Create Contact` pop-up form, in which additional addresses can be configured.

   :alt: Add a contact/address to the contact form.

On the :guilabel:`Create Contact` pop-up form,  select one of the following options:

- :guilabel:`Contact`: adds another contact to the existing contact form.
- :guilabel:`Invoice`: adds a specific invoice address to the existing contact form.
- :guilabel:`Delivery`: adds a specific delivery address to the existing contact form.
- :guilabel:`Other`: adds an alternate address to the existing contact form.

Once an option is selected, enter the corresponding contact information that should be used for the
specified address type.

Add the :guilabel:`Contact Name`, :guilabel:`Address`, :guilabel:`Email`, along with the
:guilabel:`Phone` and/or :guilabel:`Mobile` numbers below.

Set the :guilabel:`Job Position`, which appears if the :guilabel:`Contact` address type has been
selected. This is similar to the :guilabel:`Person` contact.

To add a note, click on the text field next to :guilabel:`Notes`, and write anything that is
applicable to the customer or contact.

Then, click :guilabel:`Save & Close` to save the address, and close the :guilabel:`Create Contact`
window. Or, click :guilabel:`Save & New` to save the address, and immediately input another one.

Smart buttons
=============

At the top of the contact form, there are some additional options available, known as *smart
buttons*.

Here, Odoo displays a variety of records, related to this contact, that were created on other apps.
Odoo integrates information from every single app, so there are many smart buttons.

.. example::
   For example, there is an :guilabel:`Opportunities` smart button, where all the opportunities
   related to this customer from the *CRM* app are accessible.

.. tip::
   If the corresponding applications are installed, their related smart buttons appear automatically
   on a contact form.

A user can see any :guilabel:`Meetings`, :guilabel:`Sales`, :guilabel:`POS Orders`,
:guilabel:`Subscriptions`, project :guilabel:`Tasks`, and the :guilabel:`More` smart button reveals
additional options, via a drop-down menu. A user can even quickly access :guilabel:`Purchases`,
:guilabel:`Helpdesk` tasks, :guilabel:`On-time Rate` for deliveries, :guilabel:`Invoiced`
information, :guilabel:`Vendor Bills`, and the :guilabel:`Partner Ledger` connected to this contact.

Deliveries, documents, loyalty cards, and direct debits are *also* linked to smart buttons, like
this, should there be any outstanding/on-file for this contact.

If the contact is a partner, the user can visit their partner page on the Odoo-built website by
clicking the :guilabel:`Go to Website` smart button.

Archive contacts
----------------

If a user decides they no longer want to have this contact active, the record can be archived. To do
that, go to the :icon:`fa-cog` :guilabel:`Action` menu at the top of the contact form, and click
:guilabel:`Archive`.

Then, click :guilabel:`Archive` from the resulting :guilabel:`Confirmation` pop-up window.

With this contact successfully archived, as indicated by a banner at the top, they do not show up in
the main contacts page, but they can still be searched for with the :guilabel:`Archived` filter.

.. tip::
   A contact can be *unarchived*, if the user decides to work with them again. To do that, just
   click the :icon:`fa-cog` :guilabel:`Action` menu again at the top of the archived contact form,
   and click :guilabel:`Unarchive`. Upon doing so, the :guilabel:`Archived` banner is removed, and
   the contact is restored.

==================================================

Merge contacts
==============

Odoo's *Contacts* application allows user's to merge duplicate contacts, without losing any
information in the process. This keeps the database organized, and prevents contacts from being
contacted by more than one salesperson.

.. _contacts/merge-duplicate:

Merge duplicate contacts
========================

.. danger::
   Merging is an irreversible action. Do **not** merge contacts unless absolutely certain they
   should be combined.

Navigate to the :menuselection:`Contacts app`, and select the :icon:`oi-view-list`
:guilabel:`(list)` icon. Select two or more duplicate contacts from the list, and tick the checkbox
(on the far-left) for the contacts that should be merged. Then, click the :icon:`fa-cog`
:guilabel:`Actions` icon, and select :guilabel:`Merge` from the resulting drop-down menu.

.. image:: merge/merge-menu.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The merge contacts option in the Contacts application.

This opens the :guilabel:`Merge` pop-up window. From here, review the details of the contacts before
confirming they should be merged. If any contacts in the list should **not** be merged, click the
:icon:`fa-times` :guilabel:`(delete)` icon at the far right of the contact.

.. tip::
   Click the individual contact to open the record for that contact, and view additional
   information.

.. image:: merge/merge-window.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The merge pop-up window in the Contacts application.

Click the :guilabel:`Destination Contact` field, and select an option from the drop-down list. This
field defaults to the contact record that was created first in the system.

After confirming the information on the pop-up window, click :guilabel:`Merge Contacts`.

Deduplicate contacts
====================

After the merge is finished, a pop-up window appears confirming it is complete. This pop-up window
also contains a :guilabel:`Deduplicate the other Contacts` button. This feature searches for
duplicated records, based on selected criteria, and merges them automatically, or after manual
approval.

Click the :guilabel:`Deduplicate the other Contacts` button to open the :guilabel:`Deduplicate
Contacts` pop-up window.

Select one or more fields to be used in the search for duplicated records. Duplicated contacts can
be searched, based on the following criteria:

- :guilabel:`Email`
- :guilabel:`Name`
- :guilabel:`Is Company`
- :guilabel:`VAT`
- :guilabel:`Parent Company`

.. note::
   If more than one field is selected, only records that have **all** fields in common are suggested
   as duplicates.

If necessary, select criteria to be used to exclude potential duplicates from the search. Potential
duplicates can be excluded from the search, based on the following criteria:

- :guilabel:`A user associated to the contact`
- :guilabel:`Journal Items associated to the contact`

After confirming the search criteria, click either :guilabel:`Merge with Manual Check`,
:guilabel:`Merge Automatically`, or :guilabel:`Merge Automatically all process`.

If :guilabel:`Merge with Manual Check` is selected, complete the merge by following the :ref:`steps
above <contacts/merge-duplicate>`.

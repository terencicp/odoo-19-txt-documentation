**Odoo Barcode** allows users to assign barcodes to individual products and product categories, and
track inventory movements using those barcodes. By connecting a barcode scanner, certain inventory
processes can be triggered by scanning barcodes.

Adjust inventory with barcodes
==============================

An *inventory adjustment*, or inventory audit, is the process of verifying the physical stock of
products against the quantities recorded in the database. Regular audits ensure accurate inventory
records, prevent stock discrepancies, and maintain efficient operations. In a warehouse setting,
managers typically assign inventory counts to employees, who then walk to designated locations, scan
product barcodes, and adjust quantities as needed.

Inventory adjustments can be completed through the **Barcode** application using a compatible
scanner, or the Odoo mobile app.

.. note::
   For a list of Odoo-compatible barcode mobile scanners, and other hardware for the **Inventory**
   and **Barcode** apps, refer to the `Odoo Inventory • Hardware page
   <https://www.odoo.com/app/inventory-hardware>`_.

.. seealso::
   :doc:`../../inventory/warehouses_storage/inventory_management/count_products`

.. tip::
   Odoo's **Barcode** application provides demo data with barcodes to explore the features of the
   app. These can be used for testing purposes, and can be printed from the home screen of the app.

   To access this demo data, navigate to the :menuselection:`Barcode app` and click :guilabel:`demo
   data sheet` or :guilabel:`barcodes` in the banner above the scanner.

   .. image:: adjustments/adjustments-barcode-stock-sheets.png
      :alt: Demo data prompt pop-up on Barcode app main screen.

Assigning inventory counts
==========================

Before performing an inventory count, managers can :ref:`assign <inventory/plan-counts>` counting
tasks to employees. This can be done through :menuselection:`Inventory app --> Operations -->
Physical Inventory` by selecting specific locations and products for counting, and assigning a
:guilabel:`User` to them. Once assigned, users will see pending counts when they open the
**Barcode** app.

To view a requested inventory count, navigate to the :menuselection:`Barcode app` dashboard. If a
count has been requested, the number of products to be counted is listed on the :guilabel:`Inventory
count` button.

.. image:: adjustments/assigned-count.png
   :alt: The Barcode dashboard with an assigned count.

Configuration
=============

Before an inventory adjustment can be performed with the **Barcode** app, the app has to be
installed, and configured. Navigate to :menuselection:`Inventory app --> Configuration -->
Settings`, and scroll to the :guilabel:`Barcode` section. Tick the checkbox next to
:guilabel:`Barcode Scanner`, and click :guilabel:`Save` to save any changes. If necessary, click
:guilabel:`Confirm` on the pop-up.

.. danger::
   Enabling the **Barcode** feature requires installing the **Barcode** application. Installing a
   new application on a One-App-Free database triggers a fifteen-day trial. At the end of the trial,
   if a paid subscription has not been added to the database, it will no longer be accessible.

After saving, a new drop-down menu appears under the :guilabel:`Barcode Scanner` option, labeled
:guilabel:`Barcode Nomenclature`, where either :guilabel:`Default Nomenclature` or
:guilabel:`Default GS1 Nomenclature` can be selected. Each nomenclature option determines how
scanners interpret barcodes in Odoo.

To count products using barcodes, ensure that barcodes for products and storage locations are set up
within Odoo first. Refer to this section for detailed instructions: :ref:`Set Product Barcodes
<inventory/barcode/set-barcodes>`.

.. image:: adjustments/adjustments-barcode-setting.png
   :alt: Enabled Barcode feature in Inventory app settings.

.. _inventory/barcode/perform-count:

Performing an inventory count
=============================

To perform an inventory adjustment, first navigate to the :menuselection:`Barcode app`. If assigned
counts exist, tap :guilabel:`Inventory Count` to view pending tasks.

.. image:: adjustments/adjustments-barcode-scanner.png
   :alt: Barcode app start screen with scanner.

Walk to the designated storage location, then scan the location barcode.

.. tip::
   If the warehouse *multi-location* feature is **not** enabled in the database, a source location
   does not need to be scanned. Instead, scan the product barcode to start the inventory adjustment.

Doing so highlights the location and displays all of the products stored there. Scan the barcode of
each product to adjust its count.

.. note::
   If no counts have been assigned to a user, and the :ref:`Count Entire Locations
   <inventory/barcode/count-location>` feature is **not** enabled, no products may appear after the
   location barcode is scanned.

Manually adjust quantities if necessary by tapping the :icon:`fa-pencil` :guilabel:`(edit)` icon.
Doing so opens a separate window with a keypad. Edit the number in the :guilabel:`Quantity` line to
change the quantity. Additionally, the :guilabel:`+1` and :guilabel:`-1` buttons can be clicked to
add or subtract quantity of the product, and the number keys can be used to add quantity, as well.

.. example::
   In the below inventory adjustment, the source location `WH/Stock/Shelf 1` was scanned, assigning
   the location. Then, the barcode for the product `[FURN_7888] Desk Stand with Screen` was scanned
   three times, increasing the units in the adjustment. Additional products can be added to this
   adjustment by scanning the barcodes for those specific products.

   .. image:: adjustments/adjustments-barcode-inventory-client-action.png
      :alt: Barcode Inventory Client Action page with inventory adjustment.

.. _inventory/barcode/count-location:

Count entire locations
----------------------

The :guilabel:`Count Entire Locations` feature assigns a user to count all the products within a
location once they scan the barcode for that location. This allows for easier cycle counts by
assigning an entire location to a user by assigning a single product count. During cycle counts,
users can ensure accurate inventory numbers, see if products that should be in a location are
missing, or discover products incorrectly stored within a location.

To enable this feature, navigate to :menuselection:`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings`,
and scroll to the :guilabel:`Barcode` section. Tick the :guilabel:`Count Entire Locations` checkbox,
then click :guilabel:`Save`.

.. important::
   This setting is only visible if the :guilabel:`Storage Locations` checkbox is ticked.

To perform an inventory count of an entire location, navigate to :menuselection:`Barcode app -->
Inventory Count`. Scan the desired location barcode. The app then displays all assigned products in
that location. :ref:`Proceed with the count <inventory/barcode/perform-count>` as normal.

Show quantity to count
----------------------

When conducting an inventory count, the expected quantity of products is displayed by default, to
provide the user with a baseline to use when performing the count. However, as this can result in
users relying on this count instead of performing a new count, this quantity can be hidden.

Navigate to :menuselection:`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings`. In the
:guilabel:`Barcode` section, clear the :guilabel:`Show Quantity to Count` checkbox, then click
:guilabel:`Save`.

.. image:: adjustments/show-quantity-to-count-disabled.png
   :alt: An inventory count without the show quantity to count feature enabled.

Manually add products to an inventory count
===========================================

When barcodes for location or products are not available, Odoo **Barcode** can still be used to
perform inventory counts.

To do this, navigate to the :menuselection:`Barcode app --> Inventory Count`.

To manually add products to this adjustment, click the white :guilabel:`Add Product` button at the
bottom of the screen.

This navigates to a new, blank page where the desired product, quantity, and source location must be
chosen.

.. image:: adjustments/adjustments-keypad.png
   :alt: Keypad to add products on Barcode Inventory Client Action page.

First, click the :guilabel:`Product` line, and choose the product whose stock count should be
adjusted. Then, manually enter the quantity of that product, either by changing the `1` in the
:guilabel:`Quantity` line, or by clicking the :guilabel:`+1` and :guilabel:`-1` buttons to add or
subtract quantity of the product. The number pad can be used to add quantity, as well.

Below the number pad is the :guilabel:`location` line, which should read `WH/Stock` by default.
Click this line to reveal a drop-down menu of locations to choose from, and choose the
:guilabel:`source location` for this inventory adjustment.

Click :guilabel:`Confirm` to confirm the changes.

Finalizing an inventory count
=============================

After counting all of the products, review the entries to ensure all the counted quantities are
accurately entered. To complete the inventory adjustment, click :guilabel:`Apply`.

.. tip::
   The :guilabel:`Validate` barcode can be scanned in place of clicking the :guilabel:`Apply`
   button.

Odoo then navigates back to the :guilabel:`Barcode Scanning` screen. A small green banner appears in
the top-right corner, confirming the inventory count has been updated.


==================================================
SECTION: barcode_nomenclature.rst
PATH: applications/inventory_and_mrp/barcode/operations/barcode_nomenclature.rst
==================================================

============================
Default barcode nomenclature
============================

.. |UPC| replace:: :abbr:`UPC (Universal Product Code)`
.. |EAN| replace:: :abbr:`EAN (European Article Number)`
.. |GTIN| replace:: :abbr:`GTIN (Global Trade Item Number)`
.. |GTINs| replace:: :abbr:`GTINs (Global Trade Item Numbers)`

*Barcode nomenclatures* define how barcodes are recognized and categorized. When a barcode is
scanned, it is associated to the **first** rule with a matching pattern. The pattern syntax is
described in Odoo's nomenclature list using a regular expression, and a barcode is successfully read
by Odoo if its prefix and/or length matches the one defined in the barcode's rule.

For instance, at a :doc:`Point of Sale <../../../sales/point_of_sale>` station, product weight
barcodes in the European Article Number (EAN) format, which begin with `21` and have five digits
specifying the weight, are used to weigh products and generate a barcode depicting the weight and
price. The `21` and five-digit weight is the barcode pattern used to identify the barcode and can be
customized to ensure Odoo correctly interprets all barcodes for the business.

.. note::
   Barcodes are also commonly used with Odoo's **Inventory** and **Barcode** apps.

Odoo **Barcode** supports |EAN|, Universal Product Code (UPC), and :doc:`GS1 <gs1_nomenclature>`
formats. This document exclusively focuses on :ref:`default rules and patterns in Odoo
<barcode/operations/default-nomenclature-list>`, which use |UPC| and |EAN| encoding.

.. important::
   To use |UPC| and |EAN| barcodes for uniquely identifying products across the entire supply chain,
   they **must** be `purchased from GS1 <https://www.gs1.org/standards/get-barcodes>`_.

   In Odoo, custom barcode patterns can be defined to recognize barcodes specific to the company.
   Barcodes do not need to be purchased if used only within the company, such as in the
   :ref:`example <barcode/operations/product-weight>` where the barcode is written in the |EAN|
   format.

Configuration
=============

To use default nomenclature, navigate to :menuselection:`Inventory app --> Configuration -->
Settings`. Under the :guilabel:`Barcode` section, tick the :guilabel:`Barcode Scanner` checkbox.
Doing so installs the **Barcode** app in the database.

Next, in the :guilabel:`Barcode Nomenclature` field, ensure :guilabel:`Default Nomenclature` is
selected. Then, click :guilabel:`Save`.

.. image:: barcode_nomenclature/enable-nomenclature.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Enabled barcode setting with Default Nomenclature selected.

With the **Barcode** module installed, and the :guilabel:`Default Nomenclature` selected, the
barcode actions using |UPC| and |EAN|, detailed in the :ref:`default nomenclature list
<barcode/operations/default-nomenclature-list>`, are available for use. And, by default, Odoo
automatically handles |UPC|/|EAN| conversion.

.. _barcode/operations/product-weight:

Example: product weight barcode
===============================

To better understand how barcode nomenclature is used to identify products in Odoo, this example
where product weight barcodes in |EAN| format are used to allow a :doc:`Point of Sale
<../../../sales/point_of_sale>` business to automatically print barcodes, and calculate the price
using the weight of the item.

To set up barcodes for weighted products, the following rule is used:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Rule Name
     - Barcode Pattern
     - Field in Odoo
   * - Weighted Barcodes 3 Decimals
     - (21)....{NNDDD}
     - :guilabel:`Barcode` field on product form

.. example::
   To better understand the barcode pattern for weighted products, consider the barcode,
   `2112345000008`:

   - `21`: code that identifies this a barcode for weighted products.
   - `12345`: five digits (denoted by `.....` in the table above) that identify the product.
   - `00000`: five digits (denoted by `{NNDDD}` in the table) representing the weight of the
     product. On the product form, the five weight values **must** be `00000`. The first two digits
     are whole number values, and the last three digits are decimal values. For example, "13.5
     grams" in the `{NNDDD}` format is `13500`.
   - `8`: `check digit <https://www.gs1.org/services/check-digit-calculator>`_ for `211234500000`.

   Together, these components make up a 13-character |EAN| - 13 barcode.

To configure the product barcode for `Pasta Bolognese`, the |EAN| barcode for weighted products,
`2112345000008`, is entered in the :guilabel:`Barcode` field on the product form (accessible by
going to :menuselection:`Inventory app --> Products --> Products`, and selecting the desired
product). In addition, the :guilabel:`Unit of Measure` is set to :guilabel:`kg`.

.. image:: barcode_nomenclature/barcode.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Barcode field on the product form.

Next, a customer's bowl of pasta is weighed to be `1.5` kilograms. This generates a new barcode for
the pasta, according to the weight: `211234501500`, which has a check digit of `2`. The new barcode
is `2112345015002`.

.. image:: barcode_nomenclature/weighted-barcode.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Generated barcode that includes a weight of 1.5 kg.

Ensure the products scan properly, by navigating to the :menuselection:`Barcode app --> Operations`.
Next, click any operation type, such as :guilabel:`Receipts`. Then, click the :guilabel:`New` button
to create a draft stock move. Scan the product weight barcode, such as `2112345015002`, and if the
intended product appears, the barcode setup is correct.

.. image:: barcode_nomenclature/barcode-scan.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Show successfully scanned barcode.

Create rules
============

.. important::
   Adding new rules is necessary for |UPC| and |EAN| formats that are **not** in Odoo's default
   list, since barcodes cannot be read successfully if there are unknown fields.

    While new rules can be created, Odoo fields do **not** auto-populate with information from these
    rules. `Custom development <https://www.odoo.com/appointment/132>`_ is required for this
    functionality.

To create a rule, first enable :ref:`developer mode <developer-mode>`. Then, navigate to
:menuselection:`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Barcode Nomenclatures`, and select
:guilabel:`Default Nomenclature`.

On this page, configure the following optional fields:

- :guilabel:`UPC/EAN Conversion`: determines if a |UPC|/|EAN| barcode should be automatically
  converted when matching a rule with another encoding. Options include :guilabel:`Always` (the
  default option), :guilabel:`Never`, :guilabel:`EAN-13 to UPC-A`, and :guilabel:`UPC-A to EAN-13`.
- :guilabel:`Is GS1 Nomenclature`: ensure this checkbox is **not** ticked, as the
  :guilabel:`Default Nomenclature` uses |UPC| and |EAN| encoding, *not* GS1 encoding.

.. image:: barcode_nomenclature/rule-config.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Default Nomenclature page setting fields.

On the :guilabel:`Default Nomenclature` page, click :guilabel:`Add a line` at the bottom of the
table, which opens a :guilabel:`Create Rules` pop-up window to create a new rule.

The :guilabel:`Rule Name` field is used internally to identify what the barcode represents.

The :guilabel:`Sequence` field represents the priority of the rule; meaning the smaller the value,
the higher the rule appears on the table.

The barcode :guilabel:`Type` field represents different classifications of information that can be
understood by the system (e.g., :guilabel:`Package`, :guilabel:`Lot`, :guilabel:`Location`,
:guilabel:`Coupon`, etc.).

The :guilabel:`Encoding` field specifies which encoding the barcode uses. This rule **only** applies
if the barcode uses this specific encoding. The available :guilabel:`Encoding` options are:
:guilabel:`EAN-13`, :guilabel:`EAN-8`, :guilabel:`UPC-A`, and :guilabel:`GS1-28`.

The :guilabel:`Barcode Pattern` field represents how the sequence of letters or numbers is
recognized by the system to contain information about the product. Sometimes, when a certain amount
of digits are required, the number of `.` is shown. `N` represents whole number digits, and `D`
represent decimal digits.

.. example::
   `1...` represents any 4-digit number that starts with 1. `NNDD` represents a two digit number
   with two decimal points. For example, `14.25` is 1425.

After filling in the information, click the :guilabel:`Save & New` button to save the rule, and
instantly start creating another rule. Or, click :guilabel:`Save & Close` to save the rule, and
return to the table of rules.

.. _barcode/operations/default-nomenclature-list:

==================================================

==============================
Barcode device troubleshooting
==============================

Odoo *Barcode* supports three main types of barcode scanners: USB scanners, bluetooth scanners, and
mobile computer scanners. While configuring each type of scanner, common issues may arise, in which
the scanners do not work as intended, and Odoo returns errors to the device.

Read the sections below to identify general and unique device issues, related to specific, popular
types of scanners.

General issues
==============

Refer to the following sections below for common issues involving popular barcode scanner devices.

For issues related to specific devices, refer to the :ref:`Android scanners
<barcode/setup/android-scanners>` section for mobile computer scanners, or to the :ref:`Screenless
scanners <barcode/setup/screenless-scanners>` section for USB and bluetooth scanners.

Barcode cannot be read
----------------------

One common issue encountered when using barcode scanners is an error resulting from barcodes that
cannot be read.

This can occur due to any of the following reasons:

- The barcode is damaged.
- The device cannot read the required barcode type (some scanners can only read 2D barcodes).
- The barcode being scanned is on a screen. Some scanners don't support this, and the barcodes
  **must** be printed out to be scanned. This is most common with 1D barcodes.
- The device has no battery, or is broken. To rule this out, follow the troubleshooting instructions
  in the following sections.

Odoo returns barcode error
--------------------------

All types of barcode scanners have their own device "language", which affects how they output
barcode data to Odoo's *Barcode* app. Sometimes, this can cause Odoo *Barcode* to return a barcode
error after scanning. This could be due to any of the following reasons:

- The computer is configured with a different keyboard layout than the barcode scanner. To rule this
  out, ensure that the device is configured with the same keyboard layout.

  For example, if the computer is configured to use an FR-BE keyboard, configure the scanner to send
  FR-BE keystrokes. The same logic applies if using a tablet instead of a computer.

  For more information on configuring keystrokes, refer to the :doc:`Barcode scanner setup
  <hardware>` documentation.
- For mobile computer scanners (such as Zebra devices, for example), the scanner might interpret the
  barcode differently than intended. To rule this out, scan a test barcode to see how the scanner
  interprets the barcode.

.. _barcode/setup/android-scanners:

Android scanners
================

The most recent barcode scanner models using Android and Google Chrome should work with Odoo.
However, due to the variety of models and configurations, it is recommended to first test a
scanner's compatibility with Odoo.

The Zebra product line is recommended; specifically, the **Zebra TC21 (WiFi-only)**, and **Zebra
TC26 (WiFi/cellular)**.

.. seealso::
   `Odoo Inventory & Barcode compatible hardware <https://www.odoo.com/app/inventory-hardware>`_

Barcode app does not give feedback
----------------------------------

By default, Android barcode scanners pre-process the barcode, then send a full text. Since Odoo
*Barcode* does not read this type of output, settings for each type of scanner **must** be
configured correctly.

Odoo *Barcode* expects that the scanner works like an analogue keyboard, and so, only detects *key
events*. Refer to the following sections for configuration settings for the most popular devices.

Zebra TC21/TC26
---------------

When using Zebra scanners, ensure the following keystroke configurations are set to prevent errors.

Begin on the Zebra scanner's home screen, and select the :guilabel:`DataWedge` app (the app is
represented by a :guilabel:`(light blue barcode)` icon).

On the :guilabel:`DataWedge Profiles` page, select the profile option to access the Zebra scanner's
settings.

Once the profile is selected, scroll down to the :guilabel:`Keyboard Output` option, and ensure the
:guilabel:`Enable/disable keystroke output` option is :guilabel:`Enabled`.

.. image:: device_troubleshooting/device-troubleshooting-zebra-settings.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Show keystroke option in the Zebra scanner's DataWedge app.

Once that option is enabled, go back to the :guilabel:`Profile` options page, and go to the
:guilabel:`Keystroke output` section. Then, open the :guilabel:`Key event options` submenu. Under
:guilabel:`Characters`, ensure the :guilabel:`Send Characters as Events` option is checked.

.. important::
   The :guilabel:`Send Characters as Events` option **must** be checked on the Zebra scanner, or
   Odoo **cannot** recognize the barcodes that are scanned.

Once the above steps have been taken, perform a test scan to ensure the Zebra scanner is working as
intended.

MUNBYN Android devices
----------------------

When using MUNBYN Android scanners, ensure the following configurations are set to prevent errors.

From the device's home screen, click :menuselection:`AppSettings`. On the resulting page, locate the
:guilabel:`Process mode` section, and select :guilabel:`Keyboard input`.

.. image:: device_troubleshooting/device-troubleshooting-munbyn-process-mode.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Process mode section on MUNBYN scanner's AppSettings page.

.. tip::
   The selected *Process mode* controls how data is processed after barcode data has been read out.

   *Keyboard input* enters read-out data at the position of the cursor, the same as input data on an
   analogue keyboard would.

Once the above steps have been taken, perform a test scan to ensure the MUNBYN Android scanner is
working as intended.

.. admonition:: Why is there no data output in the app after a successful scan?

   When scanning a barcode, the scanner might beep, indicating a successful scan, but there is no
   data output in the app.

   To fix this issue, adjust the output method to *keyboard analogue* in the *Scanner* app on the
   device.

   From the device's home screen, click :menuselection:`Scanner App --> Settings`. From the
   :guilabel:`Settings` page, click :guilabel:`Output Mode`. The resulting pop-up window presents
   the different output options available to users. Select :guilabel:`Keyboard Mode`, then click
   :guilabel:`OK`.

   .. image:: device_troubleshooting/device-troubleshooting-output-mode-popup.png
      :align: center
      :alt: Output mode pop-up window on MUNBYN scanner.

   Go back to the app that needs to be scanned, and click on the input dialog box first before
   scanning. Finally, perform a test scan to ensure the MUNBYN Android scanner is working as
   intended.

Datalogic Android devices
-------------------------

When using Datalogic Android scanners, ensure the following configurations are set to prevent
errors.

To view and configure all settings for the scanner, use the *Settings* app on the Datalogic Android
device. From the applications menu, select :menuselection:`Settings --> System --> Scanner
Settings`.

From the resulting list of settings, select :guilabel:`Wedge`. From this menu, under the
:guilabel:`Keyboard wedge` section, ensure that the :guilabel:`Enable keyboard wedge` feature is
activated.

Then, also under the :guilabel:`Keyboard wedge` section, locate the :guilabel:`Keyboard wedge input
mode` option. By default, the input mode is set to :guilabel:`Text injection`.

.. image:: device_troubleshooting/device-troubleshooting-wedge-menu.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Wedge configuration menu on Datalogic scanner.

Click :guilabel:`Keyboard wedge input mode`, and change the setting to :guilabel:`Key pressure`.
This ensures that scanned barcodes are translated into keyboard strokes, instead of being injected
into the text area.

.. image:: device_troubleshooting/device-troubleshooting-keyboard-wedge-input.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Keyboard wedge input mode selection on Datalogic scanner.

Once all those steps have been taken, perform a test scan to ensure the Datalogic Android scanner is
working as intended.

Screenless scanners
===================

Screenless scanners are barcode scanning devices that have no screens. These include USB scanners
and bluetooth scanners.

.. important::
   Odoo supports most USB and Bluetooth barcode scanners, as they all emulate a keyboard. However,
   to verify that a scanner is compatible with a specific keyboard layout (or can be configured to
   do so), refer to Odoo's `Inventory & Barcode compatible hardware
   <https://www.odoo.com/app/inventory-hardware>`_ documentation.

NETUM devices
-------------

By default, the NETUM barcode scanner's user manual only shows the French keyboard configuration. To
use the Belgian keyboard, scan the code below:

.. image:: device_troubleshooting/device-troubleshooting-belgium-fr-key.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Belgian FR key barcode.

Once that code has been scanned, ensure the NETUM scanner has the correct keyboard configuration,
and is working as intended.

GS1 barcode nomenclature
========================

.. _barcode/operations/gs1:

.. |AI| replace:: :abbr:`A.I. (Application Identifier)`
.. |GTIN| replace:: :abbr:`GTIN (Global Trade Item Number)`
.. |GTINs| replace:: :abbr:`GTINs (Global Trade Item Numbers)`


`GS1 nomenclature <https://www.gs1us.org/>`_ consolidates various product and supply chain data into
a single barcode. Odoo takes in `unique Global Trade Item Numbers
<https://www.gs1.org/standards/get-barcodes>`_ (GTIN), purchased by businesses, to enable global
shipping, sales, and eCommerce product listing.

Configure GS1 nomenclature to scan barcodes of sealed boxes and identify essential product
information, such as |GTIN|, lot number, quantity information, and more.

.. important::
   |GTINs| are unique product identification that **must** be `purchased from GS1
   <https://www.gs1.org/standards/get-barcodes>`_ to use GS1 barcodes.

.. seealso::

.. _barcode/operations/set-up-barcode-nomenclature:

Set up barcode nomenclature
===========================

To use GS1 nomenclature, navigate to the :menuselection:`Inventory app --> Configuration -->
Settings`. Then under the :guilabel:`Barcode` section, check the :guilabel:`Barcode Scanner` box.
Next, select :menuselection:`Barcode Nomenclature --> Default GS1 Nomenclature` from the default
barcode nomenclature options.

.. image:: gs1_nomenclature/setup-gs1-nomenclature.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Choose GS1 from dropdown and click the external link to see the list of GS1 rules.

The list of GS1 *rules* and *barcode patterns* Odoo supports by default is accessible by clicking
the :guilabel:`➡️ (arrow)` icon to the right of the :guilabel:`Barcode Nomenclature` selection.

In the :guilabel:`Open: Nomenclature` pop-up table, view and edit the GS1 :guilabel:`Rule Names`
available in Odoo. The table contains all the information that can be condensed with a GS1 barcode,
along with the corresponding :guilabel:`Barcode Pattern`.

.. tip::
   After setting GS1 as the barcode nomenclature, the :menuselection:`Barcode Nomenclatures`
   settings can also be accessed by a hidden menu that's discoverable after enabling :ref:`developer
   mode <developer-mode>`. Once enabled, navigate to the :menuselection:`Inventory app -->
   Configuration --> Barcode Nomenclatures` menu and finally, select :guilabel:`Default GS1
   Nomenclature`.

.. _barcode/operations/create-GS1-barcode:

Use GS1 barcodes in Odoo
========================

For product identification using GS1 barcodes in Odoo, businesses obtain a `unique GTIN
<https://www.gs1.org/standards/get-barcodes>`_ as an internationally distinct product identifier
purchased from GS1. This |GTIN| is combined with specific product details following GS1's designated
*barcode pattern*. The barcode pattern's arrangement of numbers and letters must adhere to GS1
conventions for accurate interpretation by global systems along the supply chain.

Every barcode starts with a 2-4 digit `application identifier
<https://www.gs1.org/standards/barcodes/application-identifiers>`_ (A.I.). This required prefix
universally indicates what kind of information the barcode contains. Odoo follows GS1 rules for
identifying information, as detailed in the :ref:`default GS1 rules list
<barcode/operations/default-gs1-nomenclature-list>`. Including the relevant |AI| from the list
enables Odoo to correctly interpret GS1 barcodes. While most barcode patterns have a fixed length
requirement, certain ones, such as lots and serial numbers, have flexible length.

.. tip::
   For flexible-length barcode patterns not placed at the end of the GS1 barcode, use the FNC1
   separator (`\\x1D`) to end the barcode.

   Example: The barcode pattern for lot numbers is 20 characters long. Instead of creating a
   20-character lot number barcode, like `LOT00000000000000001`, use the FNC1 separator to make it
   shorter: `LOT001\x1D`.

Refer to the :ref:`GS1 nomenclature list <barcode/operations/default-gs1-nomenclature-list>` to see
a comprehensive list of all barcode patterns and rules to follow. Otherwise, refer to :ref:`this
GS1 usage doc <barcode/operations/gs1_usage>` for specific examples of combining |GTIN| to product
information and configuring the workflow.

.. seealso::
   - :ref:`Lots workflow <barcode/operations/gs1-lots>`
   - :ref:`Non-unit quantities workflow <barcode/operations/quantity-ex>`

.. _barcode/operations/create-new-rules:

Create rules
------------

GS1 rules are a specific format of information contained in the barcode, beginning with an |AI| and
containing a defined length of characters. Scanning GS1 barcodes from the :ref:`default GS1 list
<barcode/operations/default-gs1-nomenclature-list>` auto-fills corresponding data in the Odoo
database.

Adding GS1 barcode rules in Odoo ensures accurate interpretation of unique, non-standard GS1
formats.

To do so, begin by turning on :ref:`developer mode <developer-mode>` and navigating to the
:guilabel:`Barcode Nomenclatures` list in :menuselection:`Inventory app --> Configuration -->
Barcode Nomenclatures`. Then, select the :guilabel:`Default GS1 Nomenclature` list item.

On the :guilabel:`Default GS1 Nomenclature` page, select :guilabel:`Add a line` at the bottom of the
table, which opens a window to create a new rule. The :guilabel:`Rule Name` field is used internally
to identify what the barcode represents. The barcode :guilabel:`Types` are different classifications
of information that can be understood by the system (e.g. product, quantity, best before date,
package, coupon). The :guilabel:`Sequence` represents the priority of the rule; this means the
smaller the value, the higher the rule appears on the table. Odoo follows the sequential order of
this table and will use the first rule it matches based on the sequence. The :guilabel:`Barcode
Pattern` is how the sequence of letters or numbers is recognized by the system to contain
information about the product.

After filling in the information, click the :guilabel:`Save & New` button to make another rule or
click :guilabel:`Save & Close` to save and return to the table of rules.

.. _barcode/operations/troubleshooting:

Barcode troubleshooting
=======================

Since GS1 barcodes are challenging to work with, here are some checks to try when the barcodes are
not working as expected:

#. Ensure that the :guilabel:`Barcode Nomenclature` setting is set as :menuselection:`Default GS1
   Nomenclature`. Jump to the :ref:`nomenclature setup section
   <barcode/operations/set-up-barcode-nomenclature>` for more details.
#. Ensure that the fields scanned in the barcode are enabled in Odoo. For example, to scan a barcode
   containing lots and serial numbers, make sure the :guilabel:`Lots & Serial Numbers` feature is
   enabled in :ref:`Odoo's settings <barcode/operations/lot-setup>` and :ref:`on the product
   <barcode/operations/lot-setup-on-product>`.
#. Omit punctuation such as parentheses `()` or brackets `[]` between the :abbr:`A.I. (Application
   Identifier)` and the barcode sequence. These are typically used in examples for ease of reading
   and should **not** be included in the final barcode. For more details on building GS1 barcodes,
   go to :ref:`this section <barcode/operations/create-GS1-barcode>`.
#. When a single barcode contains multiple encoded fields, Odoo requires all rules to be listed in
   the barcode nomenclature for Odoo to read the barcode. :ref:`This section
   <barcode/operations/create-new-rules>` details how to add new rules in the barcode nomenclature.

#. Test barcodes containing multiple encoded fields, piece by piece, to figure out which field is
   causing the issue.

   .. example::
      When testing a barcode containing the |GTIN|, lot number, and quantity, start by scanning the
      |GTIN| alone. Then, test the |GTIN| with the lot number, and finally, try scanning the whole
      barcode.

#. After diagnosing the encoded field is unknown, :ref:`add new rules
   <barcode/operations/create-new-rules>` to Odoo's default list to recognize GS1 barcodes with
   unique specifications.

   .. important::
      While the new field will be read, the information won't link to an existing field in Odoo
      without developer customizations. However, adding new rules is necessary to ensure the rest of
      the fields in the barcode are interpreted correctly.

GS1 barcode usage
=================

.. _barcode/operations/gs1_usage:

.. |AI| replace:: :abbr:`A.I. (Application Identifier)`
.. |GTIN| replace:: :abbr:`GTIN (Global Trade Item Number)`

GS1 barcodes provide a standardized format that barcode scanners can interpret. They encode
information in a :ref:`specific structure recognized globally <barcode/operations/gs1>`, allowing
scanners to understand and process supply chain data consistently.

Odoo *Barcode* interprets and prints GS1 barcodes, automating product identification and tracking
in warehouse operations such as receiving, picking, and shipping.

The following sections contain examples of how Odoo uses GS1 barcodes provided by the business to
identify common warehouse items and automate certain warehouse workflows.

.. important::
   Odoo **does not** create GS1 barcodes. Businesses must purchase a unique Global Trade Item Number
   (GTIN) from GS1. Then, they can combine their existing GS1 barcodes with product and supply chain
   information (also provided by GS1) to create barcodes in Odoo.

.. _barcode/operations/lot-setup:

Configuration
-------------

First, :ref:`enable product tracking using lots <inventory/management/track_products_by_lots>` by
navigating to :menuselection:`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings`, and checking the box
for :guilabel:`Lots & Serial Numbers` under the :guilabel:`Traceability` heading.

Then, set up the product barcode by navigating to the intended product form in
:menuselection:`Inventory app --> Products --> Products` and selecting the product. On the product
form, click :guilabel:`Edit`. Then, in the :guilabel:`General Information` tab, fill in the
:guilabel:`Barcode` field with the unique 14-digit `Global Trade Item Number (GTIN)
<https://www.gs1.org/standards/get-barcodes>`_, which is a universally recognized identifying number
that is provided by GS1.

.. important::
   On the product form, omit the |AI| `01` for |GTIN| product barcode pattern, as it is only used to
   encode multiple barcodes into a single barcode that contains detailed information about the
   package contents.

.. example::

   To record the GS1 barcode for the product, `Fuji Apple`, enter the 14-digit |GTIN|
   `20611628936004` in the :guilabel:`Barcode` field on the product form.

   .. image:: gs1_usage/barcode-field.png
      :align: center
      :alt: Enter 14-digit GTIN into the Barcode field on product form.

.. tip::
   To view a list of *all* products and their corresponding barcodes in the Odoo database, navigate
   to :menuselection:`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings`. Under the :guilabel:`Barcode`
   heading, click on the :guilabel:`Configure Product Barcodes` button under the :guilabel:`Barcode
   Scanner` section. Enter the 14-digit |GTIN| into the :guilabel:`Barcode` column, then click
   :guilabel:`Save`.

.. _barcode/operations/lot-setup-on-product:

After activating tracking by lots and serial numbers from the settings page, specify that this
feature is to be applied on each product by navigating to the :guilabel:`Inventory` tab on the
product form. Under :guilabel:`Tracking`, choose the :guilabel:`By Lots` radio button.

.. image:: gs1_usage/track-by-lots.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Enable product tracking by lots in the "Inventory" tab of the product form.

Scan barcode on receipt
-----------------------

To ensure accurate lot interpretation in Odoo on product barcodes scanned during a receipt
operation, navigate to the :menuselection:`Barcode` app to manage the :ref:`receipt picking process
<barcode/operations/scan-received-products>`.

From the :guilabel:`Barcode Scanning` dashboard, click the :guilabel:`Operations` button, then the
:guilabel:`Receipts` button to view the list of vendor receipts to process. Receipts generated from
:abbr:`POs (Purchase Orders)` are listed, but new receipt operations can also be created directly
through the :menuselection:`Barcode` app using the :guilabel:`Create` button.

On the list of receipts, click on the warehouse operation (`WH/IN`) and scan product barcodes and
lot numbers with a barcode scanner. The scanned product then appears on the list. Use the
:guilabel:`✏️ (pencil)` button to open a window and manually enter quantities for specific lot

Configure barcode for product and non-unit quantity
===================================================

To build a GS1 barcode that contains products measured in a non-unit quantity, like kilograms, for
example, the following barcode patterns are used:

+-------------+--------------------------+----------+--------------------+----------------------------+
|    Name     |        Rule Name         |   A.I.   |  Barcode Pattern   |       Field in Odoo        |

+-------------+--------------------------+----------+--------------------+----------------------------+

Scan barcode on receipt
-----------------------

To confirm that quantities are correctly interpreted in Odoo, place an order in the *Purchase* app
using the appropriate unit of measure (:guilabel:`UoM`) for the quantity of products to be
purchased.

.. seealso::
   :ref:`Simplify vendor unit conversions with UoMs
   <inventory/product_replenishment/unit-conversion>`

After the order is placed, navigate to the :menuselection:`Barcode` app to :ref:`receive the vendor
shipment <barcode/operations/scan-received-products>`.

.. example::
   On the receipt in the *Barcode* app, receive an order for `52.1 kg` of peaches by scanning the
   barcode containing the |GTIN| and quantity of peaches in kilograms.

   .. list-table::
      :widths: 50 50
      :header-rows: 1

Verify product moves
====================

For additional verification, the quantities of received products are also recorded on the
:guilabel:`Product Moves` report, accessible by navigating to :menuselection:`Inventory app -->
Reporting --> Product Moves`.

The items on the :guilabel:`Product Moves` report are grouped by product by default. To confirm the
received quantities, click on a product line to open its collapsible drop-down menu, which displays
a list of *stock move lines* for the product. The latest stock move matches the warehouse reception
reference number (e.g. `WH/IN/00013`) and quantity processed in the barcode scan, demonstrating that
the records processed in the *Barcode* app were properly stored in *Inventory*.

Barcode scanner setup
=====================

.. _barcode/setup/hardware:

Follow this guide to choose and set up a barcode scanner compatible with Odoo's *Inventory* and
*Barcode* apps.

.. figure:: hardware/barcode-scanner.png
   :align: center
   :alt: An image of an example barcode scanner.

Scanner types
=============

Before setting up a barcode scanner, it is important to determine which type of scanner best meets
the needs of the business. There are three main types of scanners that can be used with Odoo, each
with their own benefits and use cases:

- **USB scanners** are connected to a computer, and are suitable for businesses that scan products
  at a fixed location, like at the checkout line in a grocery store.
- **Bluetooth scanners** pair with a smartphone or tablet, making them both a cost-effective and
  portable barcode scanner option. In this scenario, Odoo is installed on the smartphone, allowing
  warehouse operators to handle operations, and check stock, directly through their mobile devices.
- **Mobile computer scanners** are mobile devices with a built-in barcode scanner.

  .. important::
     If using a USB scanner, ensure the scanner is compatible with the keyboard layout of the
     computer.

     If using a mobile computer scanner, ensure the device can run the Odoo mobile app properly.
     Recent models that use Android OS with the Google Chrome browser, or Windows OS with Microsoft
     Edge, should work. However, testing is crucial due to the variety of available models and
     configurations.

.. seealso::
   `Odoo Inventory & Barcode • Compatible Hardware <https://www.odoo.com/app/inventory-hardware>`_

Configuration
=============

When setting up the barcode scanner, make sure the following configurations are correct so the
scanner can properly interpret barcodes with Odoo.

Keyboard layout
---------------

When using a USB barcode scanner, match its keyboard layout with the operating system's layout for
proper interpretation of characters. Generally, the scanning mode should be set to accept a USB
keyboard (HID), with the language set based on the keyboard that is in use.

To configure the keyboard layout for a **Zebra** scanner, scan the keyboard wedge barcode for the
desired language in the scanner's user manual.

.. figure:: hardware/keyboard-barcode.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Example of a user manual for keyboard layout.

   Examples of keyboard language settings in the Zebra scanner user manual.

Automatic carriage return
-------------------------

Odoo has a default 100-millisecond delay between scans to prevent accidental double scanning. To
synchronize with the barcode scanner, set it to include a *carriage return* (:dfn:`character like
the "Enter" key on a keyboard`) after each scan. Odoo interprets the carriage return as the end of
the barcode input; so Odoo accepts the scan, and waits for the next one.

Typically, on the scanner, a carriage return is included by default. Ensure it is set by scanning a
specific barcode in the user manual, like `CR suffix ON` or `Apply Enter for suffix`.

Zebra scanner
=============

When using Zebra scanners, ensure the following keystroke configurations are set to prevent errors.

Begin on the Zebra scanner's home screen, and select the :guilabel:`DataWedge` app (the app is
represented by a :guilabel:`(light blue barcode)` icon).

On the :guilabel:`DataWedge Profiles` page, select the profile option to access the Zebra scanner's
settings.

.. warning::
   It is **not** suggested to use the "DWDemo" profile, as it does not work properly in every
   circumstance.

   Instead, it is recommended to create a new, personal profile. Once a new profile is created, add
   the *Odoo Mobile* app and *Google Chrome* app in the :guilabel:`Associated Apps` on the scanner's
   home screen.

Once the profile is selected, scroll down to the :guilabel:`Keyboard Output` option, and ensure the
:guilabel:`Enable/disable keystroke output` option is :guilabel:`Enabled`.

.. image:: hardware/enable-keystroke.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Show keystroke option in the Zebra scanner's DataWedge app.

Once that option is enabled, go back to the :guilabel:`Profile` options page, and go to the
:guilabel:`Keystroke output` section. Then, open the :guilabel:`Key event options` submenu. Under
:guilabel:`Characters`, ensure the :guilabel:`Send Characters as Events` option is checked.

.. important::
   The :guilabel:`Send Characters as Events` option **must** be checked on the Zebra scanner, or
   Odoo **cannot** recognize the barcodes that are scanned.

Once all those steps have been taken, perform a test scan to ensure the Zebra scanner is working
properly, as intended.

Honeywell mobile computer scanner
=================================

When using Honeywell scanners, follow the instructions below to ensure barcodes can be scanned in
Odoo.

Begin on the Honeywell scanner's home screen, and select :guilabel:`Settings`, represented by a
:guilabel:`⚙️ (gear)` icon. Then, click :guilabel:`Honeywell Settings`, followed by
:guilabel:`Scanning`.

From here, click :guilabel:`Internal Scanner`, followed by :guilabel:`Default Profile`. From the
resulting list of options, select :guilabel:`Data Processing Settings`.

The :guilabel:`Data Processing Settings` specify how barcode data is processed by the computer.
Locate the :guilabel:`Wedge Method` setting. By default, this is set to :guilabel:`Standard`.

.. image:: hardware/hardware-honeywell-settings.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Data processing settings options for Honeywell scanner.

Change the :guilabel:`Wedge Method` setting to :guilabel:`Keyboard`.

After completing the steps, conduct a test scan to verify the Honeywell scanner is working as
intended.

Cipherlab mobile computer scanner
=================================

When using Cipherlab scanners, follow the instructions below to ensure barcodes can be scanned in
Odoo.

Begin on the Cipherlab scanner's home screen, and navigate to the :menuselection:`App Drawer (All
Applications)`. Then, click the :guilabel:`ReaderConfig` app, represented by an orange
:guilabel:`⚙️ (gear)` icon over a blue :guilabel:`(barcode)` icon.

Next, select the :guilabel:`Default Profile`, or create a new profile, if needed.

Under the :guilabel:`General Settings`, click :guilabel:`Data Output`, followed by
:guilabel:`Keyboard Emulation`.

.. image:: hardware/hardware-cipherlab-settings.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Cipherlab scanner data output setting page.

By default, the :guilabel:`Input Method`, under :guilabel:`Keyboard Emulation`, is set to
:guilabel:`Default Mode`. Change this setting to :guilabel:`KeyEvent`.

============================
Operation types and commands
============================

Inventory operations, like :doc:`receipts and delivery orders
<../../inventory/shipping_receiving/daily_operations/receipts_delivery_one_step>`, as well as
commands, like validating a transfer or putting products in packages, can be performed by scanning
barcodes through the **Barcode** app. This allows employees to handle tasks and access menus without
the need to touch a screen or use the **Inventory** app on a computer, and allows workflow
streamlining by putting operation barcodes in the appropriate physical location.

.. image:: operation_types/barcode-default-operations.png
   :alt: Printable barcodes for Receipts, Delivery Orders, and Manufacturing.

.. _inventory/barcode/configure_operations:

Configuring operations
======================

*Operation types* in the **Inventory** and **Barcode** apps define actions that will change the
state of products in inventory. Which operation types are available to print will depend on the
settings of the database. By default, barcodes can be printed for *Receipts (WHIN)*, *Delivery
Orders (WHOUT)*, and *Manufacturing (WHMANUF)*. The *Internal Transfers (WHINT)* and *Pick (WHPICK)*
operations can also be enabled.

.. note::
   Both *Internal Transfers (WHINT)* and *Pick (WHPICK)* operations require :doc:`location barcodes
   <software>` to scan.

Internal transfers
------------------

The *Internal Transfers (WHINT)* operation barcode is available if the database is using the
*Storage Locations* feature to designate where products are located in the inventory. To enable this
setting, go to :menuselection:`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings`, then, in the
:guilabel:`Warehouse` section, tick the :guilabel:`Storage Locations` option.

Picking
-------

The *Pick (WHPICK)* operation barcode is available if the database is using the *Multi-Step Routes*
feature configured with a picking step. To enable this setting, go to :menuselection:`Inventory app
--> Configuration --> Settings`, then, in the :guilabel:`Warehouse` section, tick the
:guilabel:`Multi-Step Routes` option and save. From there, click :icon:`fa-arrow-right`
:guilabel:`Set Warehouse Routes` to open warehouse settings and select the warehouse. In the
:guilabel:`Outgoing Shipments` section, select either :guilabel:`Pick then Deliver (2 steps)` or
:guilabel:`Pick, Pack, then Deliver (3 steps)`.

.. seealso::
   - :doc:`Two-step receipt and delivery
     <../../inventory/shipping_receiving/daily_operations/receipts_delivery_two_steps>`
   - :doc:`Three-step delivery
     <../../inventory/shipping_receiving/daily_operations/delivery_three_steps>`

Print barcodes for inventory commands and operations
====================================================

Barcodes for operations and commands can be printed at any time. These documents will include all
the available inventory commands, regardless of whether they are enabled, but only the operations
that are currently enabled in the database. See :ref:`configuring operations
<inventory/barcode/configure_operations>` to enable any missing operations.

.. example::
   The `print_inventory_commands_and_operation_types` document will always show the
   :guilabel:`PUT IN PACK` command, regardless of whether the *Packages* feature is enabled, but the
   *Pick (WHPICK)* operation will only be added if *Multi-Step Routes* are configured to have a
   picking step.

.. important::
   Printing barcodes, by default, will either directly download a PDF file of the selected barcodes
   or open a new tab with a downloadable or printable PDF. To turn this into a direct printing
   operation, :doc:`connect a printer <../../../general/iot/devices/printer>`.

When first opening Barcode
--------------------------

When first opening the **Barcode** app, there is a prompt with options to print barcodes for
commands and operations, as well as some sample barcodes to print and use for testing. Clicking
these links is the easiest way to print command and operation barcodes, but will no longer be
displayed after the first time it is clicked.

.. image:: operation_types/barcode-initial-print-prompt.png
   :alt: A prompt to print demo data or barcodes for operations.

From Inventory settings
-----------------------

If the barcode print prompt is not available, inventory commands and operation types barcodes can
always be printed from the *Settings* page. Go to :menuselection:`Inventory app --> Configuration
--> Settings` and in the :guilabel:`Barcode` section under the :guilabel:`Barcode Scanner` setting,
click :icon:`fa-print` :guilabel:`Print barcode commands and operation types`.

.. image:: operation_types/print-operations-and-commands.png
   :alt: Link to print inventory operations and commands.

Individual operations
---------------------

Barcodes for individual operations, like receipts and manufacturing orders, can also be printed from
the *Operations Types* configuration menu. To select operations to print, go to
:menuselection:`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Operations Types` and tick the box by each
operation type required.

.. image:: operation_types/barcode-print-operations.png
   :alt: Available operations selected making a 'Print' button appear.

Next, click the :icon:`fa-print` :guilabel:`Print` button and select either :guilabel:`Operation
type (PDF)` to download a PDF with the operation barcodes, or :guilabel:`Operation type (ZPL)` to
send the print job to a :ref:`ZPL-enabled printer <iot/link-printer>`.

.. note::
   The :icon:`fa-print` :guilabel:`Print` button does not appear until at least one operation type
   is selected.

.. _inventory/barcode/print_order:

Print picking operations for specific orders
============================================

Receipts, manufacturing orders, transfers, and delivery orders can all be printed in advance and are
referred to in the print options menu as *picking operations* or *picking*.

In Barcode
----------

From the **Barcode** app, tap the :guilabel:`Operations` button, select the operation type, and then
the specific order to print. From there, either scan the `PRINT PICKING OPERATION` barcode if there
is one available, or tap the :icon:`fa-cog` :guilabel:`(gear)` icon to open the **Barcode** actions
menu and tap the :guilabel:`Print Picking Operation` button.

.. image:: operation_types/print-picking-barcode-cog.png
   :alt: Menu from a receipt with the 'Print Picking Operation' button.

In Inventory
------------

To print a picking from the **Inventory** app, click the appropriate operation type (*Receipt*,
*Delivery Order*, etc.) and select the individual order or the operation.

From the order, click the :icon:`fa-cog` :guilabel:`(Actions)` icon, hover over :icon:`fa-print`
:guilabel:`Print`, and click :guilabel:`Picking Operations`.

.. note::
   The type of operation can be inferred from the operation reference to help distinguish picking
   operations. For example, the "IN" in `WH/IN/00012` indicates that it is a receipt operation.
   These references are similar to, but do not exactly match the operation type barcodes.

Use barcodes for inventory operations and commands
==================================================

Operations
----------

- **Receipts** `WHIN` creates a new order to receive products into inventory.

   .. warning::
      Scanning a barcode for a receipt will always create a *new* instance of that operation, and
      will not match an already scheduled order. To scan or a specific scheduled receipt, first
      :ref:`print a picking for the individual receipt <inventory/barcode/print_order>`.

      For example, scanning **Receipts** `WHIN` will create a brand new receipt, even if the
      contents match an existing receipt exactly.

- **Delivery Orders** `WHOUT` opens the currently scheduled delivery orders.
- **Manufacturing** `WHMANUF` creates a new manufacturing order. Scanning a product barcode from
  here will add it to the *Producing* list.
- **Internal Transfers** `WHINT` creates a new transfer order. :doc:`Location barcodes <software>`
  can be scanned to designate the source and destination, or scanned direction to initiate a
  transfer in **Barcode**.
- **Pick** `WHPICK` creates a new picking operation. This will *require* a :doc:`location barcode
  <software>` for the source location.

Commands
--------

- `MAIN MENU`: Scan to return to the main menu from an inventory adjustment.
- `VALIDATE`: Scan to confirm that an operation is correct and ready to be completed.
- `CANCEL`: Scan from an operation to prevent that operation from being validated and set its status
  to *Cancelled*.
- `PRINT PICKING OPERATION`: Scan from an existing delivery order, transfer, or receipt to generate
  a PDF with the name and barcode for that operation's reference number. This can be scanned later
  to go directly to the operation.
- `PRINT DELIVERY SLIP`: Scan from an existing receipt or delivery order to generate a PDF of the
  purchase order or delivery order. This will not include a barcode.
- `PUT IN PACK`: After scanning products, this command will designate them as all being in one
  :doc:`package <../../inventory/product_management/configure/package>`. Products scanned *after*
  this command are placed in a new package if the `PUT IN PACK` command is scanned again.
- `SCRAP`: Scan this to mark a scanned product as defective, and move it to a virtual location for
  :doc:`scrap inventory <../../inventory/warehouses_storage/inventory_management/scrap_inventory>`

Print barcodes for manufacturing commands
=========================================

By default, the :guilabel:`Manufacturing` operation type can scan products and components and tap a
*Produce* button to produce them. To print barcodes for basic manufacturing operations, go to
:menuselection:`Manufacturing app --> Configuration --> Settings`, then, in the
:guilabel:`Operations` section, make sure the :guilabel:`Barcode Scanner` box is ticked and click
:icon:`fa-print` :guilabel:`Print barcode commands and operation types`.

Work order commands
-------------------

To enable more granular control of the manufacturing process through **Barcode**, enable the
:doc:`Work Orders <../../manufacturing/basic_setup/bill_configuration>` feature. To print barcodes
for work orders, go to :menuselection:`Manufacturing app --> Configuration --> Settings`, then, in
the :guilabel:`Operations` section, make sure the  :guilabel:`Work Orders` box is ticked and click
:icon:`fa-print` :guilabel:`Print barcode commands`.

.. image:: operation_types/print-work-order-commands.png

Process batch transfers
=======================

The Odoo **Barcode** app can be used to process *Batch*, *Wave*, and *Cluster* transfers that are
created in the **Inventory** app.

.. seealso::
   This document covers the steps to process transfers in the **Barcode** app. Instructions on
   creating transfers can be found below:

   - :doc:`../../inventory/shipping_receiving/picking_methods/batch`
   - :doc:`../../inventory/shipping_receiving/picking_methods/wave`
   - :doc:`../../inventory/shipping_receiving/picking_methods/cluster`

Process the batch
-----------------

First, navigate to :menuselection:`Barcode app --> Operations` and select an operation type (like
delivery orders) grouped into batches. From here, select the card for the appropriate batch
transfer, and click the :guilabel:`BATCH` smart button.

.. image:: process_transfers/batch-transfer.png
   :alt: The Delivery Orders page.

On the batch transfer screen, the products in the picking are grouped by location, and each line is
color-coded to associate products in the same picking together.

Then, follow the prompt to :guilabel:`Scan the source location` barcode for the storage location of
the first product. Scan the barcode for the product and package to process the transfer. To record
multiple quantities, click the :icon:`fa-pencil` :guilabel:`(edit)` icon, and enter the required
quantities for the picking.

Repeat this for all products, and click the :guilabel:`Validate` button to mark the transfer as
:guilabel:`Done`.

.. note::
   After creating a batch transfer and assigning a package to a picking, Odoo suggests the specified
   package by displaying the name *in italics* under the product name, ensuring pickers place
   products into the correct boxes.

   Products from the same order are labeled with the same color on the left. Completed pickings are
   highlighted in green.

.. example::
   In a batch transfer for 2 `Cabinet with Doors`, 3 `Acoustic Bloc Screens`, and 4 `Four Person
   Desks`, the `3/3` and `4/4` :guilabel:`Units` indicate that the last two product pickings are
   complete.

   `1/2` units of the `Cabinet with Doors` has already been picked, and after scanning the product
   barcode for the second cabinet, Odoo prompts the user to `Scan a serial number` to record the
   unique serial number for :ref:`product tracking <inventory/product_management/enable-lots>`.

Process receipts and deliveries with barcodes
=============================================

.. _barcode/operations/intro:

The *Barcode* app can be used to process receipts, deliveries, and other types of operations in real
time using a barcode scanner or the Odoo mobile app.

This makes it possible to process operations on the warehouse floor when they happen, instead of
having to wait to validate transfers from a computer. Processing operations this way can help to
properly attribute barcodes to the appropriate products, pickings, locations, and more.

Enable Barcode app
==================

To use the *Barcode* app to process transfers, it must be installed by enabling the feature from the
settings of the *Inventory* app.

To do so, go to the :menuselection:`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings`. Then, scroll down
to the :guilabel:`Barcode` section, and click the checkbox next to the :guilabel:`Barcode Scanner`
feature.

Once the checkbox is ticked, click :guilabel:`Save` at the top of the page to save changes.

Once the page has refreshed, new options will be displayed under the :guilabel:`Barcode Scanner`
feature: :guilabel:`Barcode Nomenclature` (with a corresponding drop-down menu), where either
:guilabel:`Default Nomenclature` or :guilabel:`Default GS1 Nomenclature` can be selected.

There is also a :guilabel:`Configure Product Barcodes` internal link arrow, and a set of
:guilabel:`Print` buttons for printing barcode commands and a barcode demo sheet.

documentation pages.

.. _barcode/operations/scan-received-products:

Scan barcodes for receipts
==========================

To process warehouse receipts for incoming products, there first needs to be a purchase order (PO)
created, and a receipt operation to process.

To create a :abbr:`PO (purchase order)`, navigate to the :menuselection:`Purchase app --> Create` to
create a new request for quotation (RFQ).

From the blank :abbr:`RFQ (request for quotation)` form, click the drop-down menu next to the
:guilabel:`Vendor` field to add a vendor. Then, on the :guilabel:`Product` line under the
:guilabel:`Products` tab, click :guilabel:`Add a product`, and select the desired product(s) to add

From this page, locate the :guilabel:`Receipts` card, and click the :guilabel:`# To Process` button
to view all outstanding receipts. Then, select the desired receipt operation to process. This
navigates to the barcode transfer screen.

.. note::
   If *only* using a barcode scanner or the Odoo mobile app, the barcodes for each transfer of a
   corresponding operation type can be scanned to be processed easily. Once scanned, the products
   that are part of an existing transfer can be scanned, and new products can be added to the
   transfer, as well. Once all products have been scanned, validate the transfer to proceed with the
   stock moves.

From this screen, an overview of all receipts to process within that transfer (**WH/IN/000XX**) is
shown. At the bottom of the screen, there are options to :guilabel:`Add Product` or
:guilabel:`Validate`, depending on if products need to be added to the operation, or if the whole
operation should be validated at once.

.. image:: receipts_deliveries/receipts-deliveries-scanner-overview.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Overview of receipts in transfer to scan.

To process and scan each product individually, choose a specific product line. The :guilabel:`+#`
button (in this case, :guilabel:`+10`) can be clicked to indicate receipt of that product, or the
:guilabel:`pencil` icon can be clicked to open a new screen to edit that product line.

From this screen, the product that's being received is listed. Under the product name, the
:guilabel:`Quantity` line can be edited. Either change the `0` in the line to the desired quantity,
or click the :guilabel:`/# Units` button (in this case, :guilabel:`/10 Units`) to automatically fill
the quantity ordered from the :abbr:`PO (purchase order)`.

.. example::
   In the reception operation `WH/IN/00019`, `10 Units` of the `Barcode Product` is expected to be
   received. `[BARCODE_PROD]` is the :guilabel:`Internal Reference` set on the product form. Scan
   the barcode of the `Barcode Product` to receive one unit. Afterwards, click the
   :guilabel:`pencil` icon to manually enter the received quantities.

Scan barcodes for delivery orders
=================================

To process warehouse deliveries for outgoing products, there first needs to be a sales order (SO)
created, and a delivery operation to process.

To create a :abbr:`SO (sales order)`, navigate to the :menuselection:`Sales app --> Create` to
create a new quotation.

From the blank quotation form, click the drop-down menu next to the :guilabel:`Customer` field to
add a customer. Then, on the :guilabel:`Product` line under the :guilabel:`Order Lines` tab, click
:guilabel:`Add a product`, and select the desired product(s) to add to the quotation.

Once ready, click :guilabel:`Save` at the top of the form, and click :guilabel:`Confirm Order` to

is shown. At the bottom of the screen, there are options to :guilabel:`Add Product` or
:guilabel:`Validate`, depending on if products need to be added to the operation, or if the whole
operation should be validated at once.

To process and scan each product individually, choose a specific product line. The :guilabel:`+1`
button can be clicked to indicate delivery of that product, or the :guilabel:`pencil icon` can be
clicked to open a new screen to edit that product line.

From this screen, the product that's being delivered is listed. Under the product name, the
:guilabel:`Quantity` line can be edited. Either change the `0` in the line to the desired quantity,
or click the :guilabel:`/# Units` button (in this case, :guilabel:`/10 Units`) to automatically fill
the quantity ordered from the :abbr:`SO (sales order)`.

Additionally, the :guilabel:`+1` and :guilabel:`-1` buttons can be clicked to add or subtract
quantity of the product, and the :guilabel:`number keys` can be used to add quantity, as well.

Below the :guilabel:`number keys` is the :guilabel:`location` line, which reads `WH/Stock` by
default, unless another location is listed on the product itself.

This is the location that the product is being pulled from for delivery. Click this line to reveal a
drop-down menu of additional locations to choose from (if this product is stored in multiple
locations in the warehouse).

.. tip::
   For warehouses that have multiple different storage locations, putaway rules, and removal
   strategies, additional steps can be added for various operation types, while using the *Barcode*
   app.

Retrieve EPC codes
==================

.. |EPC| replace:: :abbr:`EPC (electronic product code)`
.. |RFID| replace:: :abbr:`RFID (radio frequency identification)`
.. |GS1| replace:: :abbr:`GS1 (Global Standards 1)`

Electronic product codes (|EPC|) are globally unique identifiers assigned to specific products,
allowing items to be distinguished at the individual level. These identifiers support accurate
inventory management by enabling faster cycle counts, streamlined adjustments, and more precise
stock control.

After EPCs are :ref:`obtained <barcode/operations/retrieve_epcs_gs1>` from |GS1|, they are
:ref:`encoded <barcode/operations/write_epcs>` onto |RFID| tags, which are then applied to products
and used throughout the inventory process.

.. seealso::
    Set up :doc:`../setup/rfid`

Retrieving EPCs from GS1
========================

To retrieve an EPC to encode on a tag, use `GS1's EPC Encoder/Decoder tool
<https://www.gs1.org/services/epc-encoderdecoder>`__.

#. Enter the GTIN-14 barcode of the product in the application identifier :guilabel:`(01)` field.
#. Enter the product's serial number in the :guilabel:`(21)` field.
#. Specify a company prefix length.
#. Specify the size of the tag and its filter value.

Generating EPCs in Odoo
=======================

Generate EPCs for tracked products directly in Odoo. Products should be tracked by serial number,
but this is not a requirement. A GTIN-14-compatible barcode must be set on the product.

To retrieve the EPCs for a receipt of products:

#. On the receipt, click the :icon:`fa-list` :guilabel:`Detailed Operations` button next to the
   :guilabel:`Quantity` field. The :guilabel:`Detailed Operations` box opens.
#. From here, specify or generate serial numbers for the products. Be sure to save the serial
   numbers.
#. :guilabel:`Validate` the receipt.
#. Click the :guilabel:`Moves` smart button. Select all received items, then click the
   :icon:`fa-cog` :guilabel:`Actions` button, then select :guilabel:`Export`.
#. On the :guilabel:`Export Data` screen, select :guilabel:`Electronic Product Code` from the list
   of available fields, then click :guilabel:`Export`. The file downloads to the device. All of the
   EPCs for the receipt are included in that file.

.. note::
    EPCs can be exported from any :guilabel:`Moves` list, not just receipts.

.. _barcode/operations/write_epcs:

Writing EPCs to RFID tags
=========================

After retrieving the EPCs, you can use an RFID writer to write the EPCs onto RFID tags. The process
to write EPCs varies by RFID writer manufacturer. Refer to the RFID writer's documentation for more
information.

RFID
====

.. |EPC| replace:: :abbr:`EPC (electronic product code)`

RFID stands for Radio Frequency Identification. RFID enables the tracking of items using radio
waves: RFID tags are attached to products in inventory, and RFID readers can read those tags to
transmit information to a computer. RFID helps automate processes by keeping inventory accurate and
tracking internal and external moves.

RFID tags transmit electronic product codes (|EPC|), which are unique identifiers to distinguish
individual items. The |EPC| in Odoo is based on GS1 standards to consistently identify products
worldwide. GS1 nomenclature establishes common rules for encoding information within a barcode to
facilitate the global exchange of goods.

.. seealso::
   :doc:`../operations/gs1_nomenclature`

Hardware
========

The following are required to begin working with RFID in Odoo:

- Zebra TCX Series mobile computer, or
- Android Smartphone

Paired with:

- Zebra RFD40 (can read and write RFID tags)

Configuration
=============

Before using RFID tags to manage inventory, the Android Package Kit (APK) with RFID support must be
installed on the mobile computer or smartphone.

.. important::
   Before installing the APK on an individual device, first enable the ability to install unknown
   apps in the device settings. Find this setting in the device's :guilabel:`App` or :guilabel:`App
   & Notification` settings, under the :guilabel:`Special access` or :guilabel:`Special app access`
   section.

Then, download the APK. On the :guilabel:`Downloads` page, under the :guilabel:`Mobile Application`
section, click :guilabel:`Download` next to the :guilabel:`Android` option, then select
:guilabel:`Download APK (with Zebra RFID support)` from the drop-down menu. Download this file via a
computer and transfer the APK via USB or Bluetooth, or use the device's web browser to download the
APK.

.. image:: rfid/download-apk.png
   :alt: Download the APK from the Download page.

Install the APK. If :guilabel:`Install unknown apps` is enabled for the device's web browser,
install the APK directly from the browser download notification. If :guilabel:`Install unknown apps`
is enabled for the device's file manager, open it and navigate to the location where the file is
stored, then tap it to install the APK.

Then, when reading or writing RFID tags, ensure that the Zebra device and the smart device are
paired and connected.

Set a compatible barcode
========================

Before you can manage inventory using RFID tags, a compatible barcode must be assigned to the
products. Set the product barcode in the product form.

.. seealso::
   :ref:`Set product barcodes <inventory/barcode/set-barcodes>`

To work with RFID, the product barcode must be GTIN-14-compatible, and inventory tracking must be
enabled for the product. Product barcodes that are not GTIN-14-compatible must be upgraded to work
with RFID.

.. note::
    Tracking by serial number or lots does not need to be enabled for this feature to work properly.

Limitations
===========

- The serial number that is part of the |EPC| must only be numeric, as SGTIN-96 is the only
  supported encoding scheme for RFID tags in Odoo. Alphanumeric serial numbers are **not**
  supported.
- For products tracked by lot, the lot can be scanned in, but it will be considered as one lot with
  a quantity of `1`. It does not count individual products in a receipt.
- Only ultra-high frequency (UHF) RFID tags are supported.
- Products need to be GS1-registered because barcodes must be unique.

Manage inventory with RFID
==========================

Managing inventory with an RFID barcode scanner is possible with the **Barcodes** app and a physical
RFID scanner.

.. seealso::
   :doc:`../setup/rfid`

Make sure the RFD40 scanner is paired and connected to the mobile computer or smartphone. Open an
operation (like a receipt, transfer, delivery order, or manufacturing order), or count inventory
using the RFID scanner. Scanning an existing operation barcode pulls up the relevant inventory or
manufacturing documents in Odoo on the mobile device.

Overview of the workflow
========================

With the RFD40 scanner in hand, open the **Barcode** app on the computer or phone. Open the
operation record (via the **Barcode** interface or scanning the operation barcode), or open the
:guilabel:`Inventory count` operation. Scan the RFID barcodes for the product.

.. seealso::
   :doc:`../setup/operation_types`

To begin managing inventory using RFID tags, open the **Barcode** app on the smart device.

.. _inventory/barcode/rfid_manage:

Manage inventory
================

From the **Barcode** app, scan the operation barcode or tap the :guilabel:`Operations` button to
open operations for receipts, internal transfers, delivery orders, or manufacturing orders. If the
reading device is not connected, Odoo will automatically connect to the device. When the device is
connected, a toast notification appears on the screen that verifies the connection. Scan the
products, then validate the scan on the mobile computer or smartphone.

.. image:: scan_rfid/validate-receipt.png
   :alt: Validate the operation on the mobile device.

.. _inventory/barcode/rfid_count:

Counting inventory
==================

It is required by many factories and warehouses to keep track of inventory, including regular counts
of products to ensure all records are correct. To change the amount of a product in stock, or adjust
inventory, open the :guilabel:`Inventory count` operation. Scan the products to count. If necessary,
verify the count manually. You can update the count by clicking the :icon:`fa-pencil`
:guilabel:`(edit)` icon. Click :guilabel:`Apply` to apply the count on the smart device.

Barcodes for lot and serial numbers
===================================

The **Barcode** app saves time and prevents user errors while handling :doc:`lot
<../../inventory/product_management/product_tracking/lots>` and :doc:`serial numbers
<../../inventory/product_management/product_tracking/serial_numbers>`. Instead of typing long
sequences of characters, print and scan barcodes instead.

Configuration
=============

To use lot or serial numbers:

#. They must be enabled in the database.
#. Tracking by lot or serial number must be selected for each product.

See the :doc:`serial numbers documentation
<../../inventory/product_management/product_tracking/serial_numbers>` and :doc:`lots documentation
<../../inventory/product_management/product_tracking/lots>` to learn how to start using this
feature.

GS1-compatible QR codes
-----------------------

:doc:`GS1 <../operations/gs1_nomenclature>` nomenclature can be used for serial numbers and lots.

To enable GS1 barcodes for lots and serial numbers, go to :menuselection:`Inventory app -->
Configuration --> Settings` and in the :guilabel:`Traceability` section under :guilabel:`Lots &
Serial Numbers`, tick the box for :guilabel:`Print GS1 Barcodes for Lots & Serial Numbers`.

.. image:: serial_numbers_lots/enable-gs1-barcodes.png
   :alt: Inventory settings with 'Print GS1 Barcodes for Lots & Serial Numbers' ticked.

.. warning::
   GS1 lot and serial number barcodes require a 2D-capable scanner to be scanned. See :doc:`hardware
   configuration <hardware>` to ensure that the feature is compatible with available equipment.

.. _inventory/barcode/mandatory-scan:

Mandatory and optional scanning
-------------------------------

Operation types, like receipts and delivery orders, :ref:`can be configured individually
<inventory/product_management/operation-type-setting>` to determine whether they require a serial or
lot number to process the operation. Additionally, the *Barcode* tab of each operation type
configures whether scanning the lot or serial number is mandatory. *Mandatory scan* specifies that
the only way to input a required serial number or lot number is by scanning a barcode, while
*optional scan* allows users to manually type in a barcode if necessary.

To make it mandatory to scan a barcode for serial numbers and lots, go to :menuselection:`Inventory
app --> Configuration --> Operations Types` and select the operation type where barcodes should be
required for serial numbers. Then, click the :guilabel:`Barcode App` tab, and in the
:guilabel:`MANDATORY SCAN` section set :guilabel:`Lot/Serial` to :guilabel:`Mandatory Scan`.

.. image:: serial_numbers_lots/optional-scan.png
   :alt: Selecting 'Optional Scan' in the Receipts operation type.

Barcodes for products and lots
==============================

To print a barcode for one or multiple product lot and serial numbers, go to
:menuselection:`Inventory app --> Products --> Lots / Serial Numbers`. In the list view, tick the
checkbox for each the product to print, click the :icon:`fa-print` :guilabel:`Print` button, and
select either PDF or ZPL depending on printer setup.

.. image:: serial_numbers_lots/select-products-to-print.png
   :alt: Three selected products and a Print button showing 'Lot/Serial Number (PDF)' highlighted.

Operations
==========

For any product that is tracked by lot or serial number, performing an operation with barcode can be
from the main **Barcode** page by tapping :guilabel:`Operations` and tapping the desired operation
in the interface or scanning the barcode for specific picking order. Once the order is scanned,
select the product by tapping or scanning a barcode and scan the lot or serial number for each
quantity.

.. tip::
   Because vendor lot and serial number barcodes could be damaged in transit and arrive in a state
   that cannot be scanned, it is a good practice to :ref:`set serial number or lot scanning to
   optional <inventory/barcode/mandatory-scan>`. Otherwise, a broken barcode would block validation
   of the receipt.

For products that are starting out without a serial number, there are three options to manage them:
manually typing in the number, generating them ahead of time, or disabling serial numbers for that
operation.

Manually input serial and lot numbers
-------------------------------------

For instances where there are few products or rare shipments, it may be easiest to type lot or
serial numbers in at the time of receipt. After opening an existing receipt or creating a new one
and scanning the product bar code, tap the :icon:`fa-pencil` :guilabel:`(pencil)` icon. Tap the
:guilabel:`Serial/Lot Number` field and enter the serial number and tap :guilabel:`Confirm`.

.. image:: serial_numbers_lots/manual-sn-input.png
   :alt: Typing in a serial number.

Generate serial numbers before a receipt
----------------------------------------

Lot and serial numbers can be generated from a scheduled receipt before the products arrive. This
has the advantage of making it possible to print all the serial numbers with the picking order for
the receipt.

To generate lot and serial numbers, in the **Inventory** app click :guilabel:`Receipts` and select
the receipt that requires generated lot or serial numbers. In the :guilabel:`Operations` tab, find
the line for the product, and click the :icon:`fa-list` :guilabel:`(list)` icon. In the
:guilabel:`Open: Stock move` pop-up menu, click :guilabel:`Generate Serials/Lots`.

.. image:: serial_numbers_lots/serial-number-generate.png
   :alt: Generate serial numbers for an incoming shipment.

.. seealso::
   :ref:`Assign serial numbers <inventory/product_management/assign-sn>`

Disable lot and serial numbers for a receipt
--------------------------------------------

With lot and serial numbers disabled for an operation, products that are tracked by these methods
can be received without supplying a serial number or lot number. It is still possible to scan a
serial number at the receipt stage, but the missing numbers will need to be :ref:`created in the
Inventory app <inventory/product_management/already-in-stock>`.

To disable the use of serial numbers for a particular operation type, go to
:menuselection:`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Operations Types` and select the operation type.
In the :guilabel:`LOTS/SERIAL NUMBERS` section, untick :guilabel:`Create New` and :guilabel:`Use
Existing ones`.

.. note::
   The *Create New* option will require the user to supply a serial number or lot number, either by
   scanning or type (if :ref:`optional scan <inventory/barcode/mandatory-scan>` is enabled), and
   will not :ref:`automatically generate serial numbers
   <inventory/product_management/generate-serials>` the way the **Inventory** app can.

Product and location barcodes
=============================

.. |GTIN| replace:: :abbr:`GTIN (Global Trade Item Number)`

Inventory operations like product configuration can be streamlined by taking advantage of barcode
scanning features. Assigning barcodes to products and locations is a key step in using the
**Barcode** app, and users can conveniently populate fields with a barcode scanner. This reduces
manual entry, minimizes errors, and speeds up common tasks like product selection, location
assignment, and inventory adjustments.

Configuration
=============

Barcode nomenclature
--------------------

Most retail products use EAN-13 barcodes, also known as Global Trade Identification Numbers (GTIN).
To create a new |GTIN| for a product, a company must have a GS1 Company Prefix. See :doc:`GS1
nomenclature <../operations/gs1_nomenclature>` for more information about using this system.

Odoo supports using any string as a barcode, so users can also create custom internal references to
use with barcode scanners. See :doc:`Default nomenclature <../operations/barcode_nomenclature>` to
learn about optional conventions around barcodes and default values in Odoo

To change the barcode nomenclature, go to :menuselection:`Inventory app --> Configuration -->
Settings` and scroll down to the :guilabel:`Barcode` section to select the nomenclature under
:guilabel:`Barcode Scanner`.

.. image:: software/barcodes-setup-change-nomenclature.png
   :alt: Changing barcode nomenclature in Inventory app settings.

.. _barcode/setup/barcodelookup:

Barcode lookup
--------------

Odoo can automatically add product information using the :guilabel:`Stock Barcode Database` setting
for any :abbr:`UPC (Universal Product Code)`, :abbr:`EAN (European Article Number)`, or :abbr:`ISBN
(International Standard Book Number)` barcode.

To enable automatic barcode look up, go to :menuselection:`Inventory app --> Configuration -->
Settings` and scroll down to the :guilabel:`Barcode` section to tick the box for :guilabel:`Stock
Barcode Database`.

.. seealso::
   :doc:`Barcode Lookup <barcodelookup>`

.. _inventory/barcode/set-barcodes:

Set product barcodes
====================

Barcodes can be assigned to existing products from the *Product Barcodes* configuration page or from
any product form in the **Inventory**, **Manufacturing** or **Purchase** apps. The barcode field can
be populated either by typing or using scanner input.

When adding a new product, the :ref:`barcode lookup feature <barcode/setup/barcodelookup>` can be
used to automatically find information about a product based on its barcode, and new products can be
added to the database directly from the **Barcode** app by scanning a barcode.

From Barcode app
----------------

New products definitions can be added to the database product lists as well as having their on-hand
inventory tracked from the **Barcode** app, if the :ref:`Barcode Lookup feature
<barcode/setup/barcodelookup>` is enabled. To create a new receipt for scanning new products, choose
one of two methods:

#. From the **Barcode** front page, tap :guilabel:`Operations`, tap :guilabel:`Receipts`, and then
   tap the :guilabel:`New` button.
#. Scan a printed :guilabel:`Receipts (WHIN)` inventory command barcode.

.. image:: software/barcode-new-receipt.png
   :alt: Empty new receipt form.

Scanning a product that is not currently in inventory prompts a message that the product does not
exist, with a button option to :guilabel:`Create New Product`. Pressing this button will search the
`Barcode Lookup <https://www.barcodelookup.com/>`_ database for a product matching the code and
format, create a new product definition in the Odoo database with the available information, and add
that product to the receipt to track the quantity on hand in inventory.

.. image:: software/barcode-scan-for-new-product.png
   :alt: New product confirmation dialog.

.. note::
   Even if a transfer order with a product created through **Barcode** is cancelled, the product
   remains available in the products list in the **Inventory** app unless it is deleted.

From a product form
-------------------

Barcodes can be added to both existing products and new products as they are created through the
products configuration form. To access a product's form, go to :menuselection:`Inventory app -->
Products --> Products` and select the product to add a barcode to.

In the :guilabel:`General Information` tab, click the :guilabel:`Barcode` field to either type in
the barcode or use a scanner to input the barcode value.

.. image:: software/barcode-add-to-product-form.png

.. note::
   If using :doc:`product variants <../../../sales/sales/products_prices/products/variants>`,
   configure barcodes on individual variants and not the product template to allow scanning to
   retrieve the variants.

From Inventory settings
-----------------------

To access the *Product Barcodes* configuration page, go to :menuselection:`Inventory app -->
Configuration --> Settings`. In the :guilabel:`Barcode` section, under the :guilabel:`Barcode
Scanner` feature, click :icon:`fa-arrow-right` :guilabel:`Configure Product Barcodes`. From this
list view, click the :guilabel:`Barcodes` column for any product to enter its barcode. Barcode
scanners will populate this field when the product is scanned.

.. image:: software/product-barcodes-configure.png

Create and process transfers with barcodes
==========================================

The *Barcode* app can be used to process internal transfers for all types of products, including
transfers for products tracked using lots or serial numbers. Transfers can be created from scratch
in real time using an Odoo-compatible barcode scanner or the Odoo mobile app.

For a list of Odoo-compatible barcode mobile scanners, and other hardware for the *Inventory* app,
refer to the `Odoo Inventory • Hardware page <https://www.odoo.com/app/inventory-hardware>`_.

Enable Barcode app
==================

To use the *Barcode* app to process transfers, it must be installed by enabling the feature from the
settings of the *Inventory* app.

To do so, go to the :menuselection:`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings`. Then, scroll down
to the :guilabel:`Barcode` section, and click the checkbox next to the :guilabel:`Barcode Scanner`
feature.

Once the checkbox is ticked, click :guilabel:`Save` at the top of the page to save changes.

When the page has refreshed, new options are displayed under the :guilabel:`Barcode Scanner`
feature: :guilabel:`Barcode Nomenclature` (with a corresponding drop-down menu), where either
:guilabel:`Default Nomenclature` or :guilabel:`Default GS1 Nomenclature` can be selected. The
nomenclature selected changes how scanners interpret barcodes in Odoo.

There is also a :guilabel:`Configure Product Barcodes` internal link arrow, and a set of
:guilabel:`Print` buttons for printing barcode commands and a barcode demo sheet.

For more on setting up and configuring the :guilabel:`Barcode` app, refer to the :doc:`Set up your
barcode scanner <../setup/hardware>` and :doc:`Activate the Barcodes in Odoo <../setup/software>`
documentation pages.

Scan barcodes for internal transfers
====================================

To create and process internal transfers for products in a warehouse, the :guilabel:`Storage
Locations` and :guilabel:`Multi-Step Routes` features **must** be enabled.

To do so, go to the :menuselection:`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings`. Then, scroll down
to the :guilabel:`Warehouse` section, and click the checkboxes next to :guilabel:`Storage Locations`
and :guilabel:`Multi-Step Routes`.

Then, click :guilabel:`Save` at the top of the page to save changes.

Create an internal transfer
---------------------------

To process existing internal transfers, there first needs to be an internal transfer created, and an
operation to process.

To create an internal transfer, navigate to the :menuselection:`Inventory app`. From the
:guilabel:`Inventory Overview` dashboard, locate the :guilabel:`Internal Transfers` card, and click
on the :guilabel:`0 To Process` button.

Then, click :guilabel:`Create` in the top left of the resulting page. This navigates to a new
:guilabel:`Internal Transfer` form.

On this blank form, the :guilabel:`Operation Type` is automatically listed as :guilabel:`Internal
Transfers`. Under that field, the :guilabel:`Source Location` and :guilabel:`Destination Location`
are set as :guilabel:`WH/Stock` by default, but can be changed to whichever locations the products
are being moved from, and moved to.

.. image:: transfers_scratch/transfers-scratch-internal-transfer-form.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Blank internal transfer form with source location and destination location.

Once the desired locations have been selected, products can be added to the transfer. On the
:guilabel:`Product` line under the :guilabel:`Products` tab, click :guilabel:`Add a product`, and
select the desired product(s) to add to the transfer.

Once ready, click :guilabel:`Save` at the top of the form to save the new internal transfer. Once
saved, click the :guilabel:`Detailed Operations` icon (four lines, at the far right of the
:guilabel:`Product` line) to open the :guilabel:`Detailed Operations` pop-up window.

.. image:: transfers_scratch/transfers-scratch-detailed-operations-popup.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Internal transfer detailed operations pop-up window.

From the pop-up, click :guilabel:`Add a line`.

Then, in the :guilabel:`To` column, change the location from :guilabel:`WH/Stock` to a different
location, where the products should be moved.

Next, in the :guilabel:`Done` column, change the quantity to the desired quantity to transfer. Once
ready, click :guilabel:`Confirm` to close out the pop-up window.

Scan barcodes for internal transfer
-----------------------------------

To process and scan barcodes for internal transfers, navigate to the :menuselection:`Barcode app`.

Once inside the :guilabel:`Barcode app`, a :guilabel:`Barcode Scanning` screen displaying different
options is presented.

To process internal transfers, click on the :guilabel:`Operations` button at the bottom of the
screen. This navigates to an :menuselection:`Operations` overview page.

.. image:: transfers_scratch/transfers-scratch-barcode-app.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Barcode app start screen with scanner.

From this page, locate the :guilabel:`Internal Transfers` card, and click the :guilabel:`# To
Process` button to view all outstanding internal transfers. Then, select the desired operation to
process. This navigates to the barcode transfer screen.

.. note::
   When using the *Barcode* app without the *Inventory* app (**only** if using a barcode scanner or
   the Odoo mobile app), the barcodes for each transfer of a corresponding operation type can be
   scanned to be processed easily.

   Once scanned, the products that are part of an existing transfer can be scanned, and new products
   can be added to the transfer, as well. Once all products have been scanned, validate the transfer
   to proceed with the stock moves.

From this screen, an overview of all products to process within that specific internal transfer
(**WH/INT/000XX**) is shown. At the bottom of the screen, there are options to :guilabel:`Add
Product` or :guilabel:`Validate`, depending on if products need to be added to the operation, or if
the whole operation should be validated at once.

.. image:: transfers_scratch/transfers-scratch-receipts-overview.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Overview of receipts in transfer to scan.

Then, scan the barcode of the product to process the internal transfer.

Or, to process and scan each product individually, choose a specific product line. The
:guilabel:`+ 1` button can be clicked to add additional quantity of that product to the transfer, or
the :guilabel:`pencil icon` can be clicked to open a new screen to edit that product line.

In the product's pop-up window, the product and the units to process is displayed with a number pad.
Under the product name, the :guilabel:`Quantity` line can be edited. Change the number in the line
to the quantity listed to be transferred on the internal transfer form.

.. example::
   In the internal transfer operation `WH/INT/000XX`, `50 Units` of the `Transfer Product` is
   moved from `WH/Stock` to `WH/Stock/Shelf 1`. `[TRANSFER_PROD]` is the :guilabel:`Internal
   Reference` set on the product form. Scan the barcode of the `Transfer Product` to receive one
   unit. Afterwards, click the :guilabel:`pencil icon` to manually enter the transferred quantities.

   .. image:: transfers_scratch/transfers-scratch-product-line-editor.png
      :align: center
      :alt: Product line editor for individual transfer in Barcode app.

Additionally, the :guilabel:`+1` and :guilabel:`-1` buttons can be clicked to add or subtract
quantity of the product, and the number keys can be used to add quantity, as well.

Below the number keys are the two :guilabel:`location` lines, which read whichever locations were
previously specified on the internal transfer form, in this case `WH/Stock` and `WH/Stock/Shelf 1`.
Click these lines to reveal a drop-down menu of additional locations to choose from.

Once ready, click :guilabel:`Confirm` to confirm the changes made to the product line.

Then, from the overview page with all products to process within that transfer (**WH/INT/000XX**),
click :guilabel:`Validate`. The receipt has now been processed, and the *Barcode* app can be closed
out.

.. tip::
   The *Barcode* app can also be used to scan products in internal transfers containing unique lot
   numbers and serial numbers.

   From the barcode transfer screen, scan the barcode of a lot or serial number, and Odoo
   automatically increases the quantity of the product to the quantity recorded in the database. If
   the same lot or serial number is shared between different products, scan the product barcode
   first, then the barcode of the lot/serial number.

   products by scanning their barcodes during internal transfers.

Create a transfer from scratch
==============================

In addition to processing and scanning barcodes for existing, previously-created internal transfers,
the *Barcode* app can also be used to create transfers from scratch, simply by scanning a printed
operation type barcode.

.. admonition:: Did you know?

   Odoo's *Barcode* application provides demo data with barcodes to explore the features of the app.
   These can be used for testing purposes, and can be printed from the home screen of the app. To
   access this demo data, navigate to the :menuselection:`Barcode app` and click :guilabel:`stock
   barcodes sheet` (bolded and highlighted in blue) in the information pop-up above the scanner.

   .. image:: transfers_scratch/transfers-scratch-demo-data.png
      :align: center
      :alt: Demo data prompt pop-up on Barcode app main screen.

To do this, first navigate to the :menuselection:`Barcode app`. Once inside the *Barcode* app, a
:guilabel:`Barcode Scanning` screen displaying different options is presented.

From this screen, when using a USB or bluetooth barcode scanner, directly scan the product barcode.

When using a smartphone as the barcode scanner, click the :guilabel:`Tap to Scan` button (next to
the camera icon, at the center of the screen). This opens a :guilabel:`Barcode Scanner` pop-up
screen that enables the camera of the device being used.

Face the camera toward the printed operation type barcode to scan it. Doing so processes the
barcode, and navigates to a barcode transfer screen.

From this screen, an overview of all products to process within that specific internal transfer
(**WH/INT/000XX**) is shown. Since this is a new transfer created from scratch, however, there
should not be any products listed on the page.

To add products, scan the product barcode. If the barcode is not available, manually enter the
product into the system by clicking the :guilabel:`Add Product` button at the bottom of the screen,
and add the products and product quantities that should be transferred.

Once ready, click :guilabel:`Confirm` to confirm the changes made to the product line.

.. image:: transfers_scratch/transfers-scratch-blank-product-editor.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Blank product editor in scratch internal transfer.

Then, from the overview page with all products to process within that transfer (**WH/INT/000XX**),
click :guilabel:`Validate`. The internal transfer has now been processed, and the *Barcode* app can
be closed out.

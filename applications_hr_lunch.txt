Lunch
=====

The **Lunch** application in Odoo allows users to conveniently order food and pay for their meal
directly from the database.

Before employees can use the **Lunch** application, there are a number of configurations that need
to be made: :ref:`settings <lunch/settings>`, :doc:`vendors <lunch/vendors>`, :ref:`locations
<lunch/locations>`, :doc:`products <lunch/products>`, and :ref:`product categories
<lunch/product-categories>`. Once these are created and configured, employees can view offerings and
order food.

.. _lunch/settings:

Settings
========

In the :guilabel:`Settings` menu, only two items need to be configured: overdraft settings and
notifications. To access the settings, navigate to :menuselection:`Lunch app --> Configuration -->
Settings`.

Configure the following:

- :guilabel:`Lunch Overdraft`: enter the maximum overdraft amount for employees. The currency format
  is determined by the localization setting of the company.
- :guilabel:`Reception notification`: set the message users receive via the **Discuss** app when
  their food has been delivered. The default message `Your lunch has been delivered. Enjoy your
  meal!` populates this field, but can be modified, if desired.

.. tip::
   If a database has multiple languages installed, many forms in the **Lunch** application have the
   option of entering translations for various fields.

   If translations are available to be configured, a language code appears next to a translatable
   field on a form. To add translations for that field, click the two letter language code (for
   example, :guilabel:`EN` for English) and a translation pop-up window appears.

   The following is an example for the :guilabel:`Reception notification` field in the settings
   menu:

   Navigate to :menuselection:`Lunch app --> Configuration --> Settings`. Click the :guilabel:`EN`
   In the top-right of the text box beneath the :guilabel:`Reception notification` section. A
   :guilabel:`Translate: company_lunch_notify_message` pop-up window loads with the option to enter
   a translation for the other languages used by the database.

   The first column lists the different languages in alphabetical order, with the currently selected
   language in bold. The second column has the currently configured message in each column. The last
   column in the far-right provides a text box to type in a translation for each language.

   Enter the text that should appear for each language, then click :guilabel:`Save`.

  .. image:: lunch/translation.png
     :alt: The translation text box, with the current language highlighted, and the Arabic
           translation field highlighted.

.. _lunch/locations:

Locations
=========

By default, Odoo creates an `HQ Office` location when the **Lunch** application is installed. If a
company has more than one location, they must be configured.

To add a location, navigate to :menuselection:`Lunch app --> Configuration --> Locations`. The
currently configured locations appear in a list view. Click the :guilabel:`New` button in the
top-left corner and a blank line appears beneath the last location in the list.

Enter the name of the location in the field. Next, click into the :guilabel:`Address` field to the
right of the name, and enter the location's address. It is possible to enter multiple lines in the
address field.

Repeat this for all locations that need to be added.

.. image:: lunch/locations.png
   :alt: A list view of the locations with the new button highlighted.

Alerts
======

It is possible to set up alerts that can either be displayed in the **Lunch** app, or be sent to
specific employees via the **Discuss** app.

No alerts are preconfigured by default. To set up an alert, navigate to :menuselection:`Lunch app
--> Configuration --> Alerts`. Click the :guilabel:`New` button in the top-left corner and a blank
lunch alert form loads. Enter the following information on the form:

- :guilabel:`Alert Name`: enter a name for the alert. This should be short and descriptive, such as
  `New Lunch Vendor` or `Order by 11:00 AM`. This field is **required**.
- :guilabel:`Display`: select whether the alert is visible in the **Lunch** app (:guilabel:`Alert in
  app)` or sent to employees via the **Discuss** app in a chat window (:guilabel:`Chat
  notification`).

  - :guilabel:`Recipients`: this field only appears if :guilabel:`Chat notification` is selected for
    the :guilabel:`Display` option. Select who receives the chat alert. The options are:
    :guilabel:`Everyone`, :guilabel:`Employee who ordered last week`, :guilabel:`Employee who
    ordered last month`, or :guilabel:`Employee who ordered last year`.

- :guilabel:`Location`: select the locations the alert should appear for from the drop-down menu.
  Multiple locations can be selected. This field is **required**, therefore, if the alert applies to
  all locations, select all the locations from the drop-down menu.
- :guilabel:`Show Until`: if the alert should expire on a specific date, select the date from the
  calendar picker.
- :guilabel:`Active`: this option is on (appears green) by default. To turn off the alert, click the
  toggle so that it no longer appears green.
- :guilabel:`Message`: Enter the alert message in this field. This field is **required**.
- :guilabel:`Notification Time`: select the days of the week the alert should be sent. By default,
  all seven days are active. Click on a checkbox to change the setting from active to inactive.

  If :guilabel:`Chat notification` was selected for the :guilabel:`Display` option, a
  :guilabel:`Time` field also appears. Enter the time the chat message should be sent. Next, select
  if the time is either :guilabel:`AM` or :guilabel:`PM` using the drop-down menu to the right of
  the :guilabel:`Time` field.

==================================================

================
Lunch management
================

In Odoo's **Lunch** application, it is required to have someone manage the orders, vendors, and
products. In addition, someone must be responsible for the orders, and notifying employees when
their orders have arrived. This can be the same person.

Orders can be :ref:`cancelled <lunch/cancel>`, :ref:`sent to the vendor <lunch/send-orders>`,
:ref:`confirmed <lunch/confirm-orders>` upon arrival, and :ref:`employees can be notified
<lunch/notify>`, either from the :ref:`Today's Orders <lunch/todays-orders>` dashboard, or the
:ref:`Control Vendors <lunch/control_vendors>` dashboard.

To manage the **Lunch** app, users need the appropriate :guilabel:`Administrator` rights. These can
be set by navigating to the :menuselection:`Settings app` and selecting :guilabel:`Manage Users`.
Then, click on the desired user to view their access rights.

For more information on access rights, refer to the :doc:`Access rights
<../../general/users/access_rights/>` documentation.

.. note::
   Only users with administration rights are able to view the :guilabel:`Manager` and
   :guilabel:`Configuration` menus in the **Lunch** application.

.. _lunch/todays-orders:

Today's Orders
==============

To view and manage the orders for the day, navigate to :menuselection:`Lunch app --> Manager -->
Today's Orders`. All orders for the day are presented in a list view on the :guilabel:`Today's
Orders` dashboard, with a filter for :guilabel:`Today`, and grouped by :guilabel:`Vendor`, by
default.

The following information appears in the list:

- :guilabel:`Order Date`: the date the order was placed.
- :guilabel:`Vendor`: the vendor the product is being ordered from.
- :guilabel:`Product`: the specific product ordered.
- :guilabel:`Extras`: any extras selected for the product.
- :guilabel:`Notes`: any information needed to be sent to the vendor.
- :guilabel:`User`: the user who ordered the product.
- :guilabel:`Lunch Location`: where the product is set to be delivered.
- :guilabel:`Price`: the total price for the product, including all extras.
- :guilabel:`Status`: the current status of the product.
- :guilabel:`Company`: the company under which the order was placed. This only appears in a
  multi-company database.

.. image:: management/today.png
   :alt: The list that appears in the Today's Orders dashboard, with the filters and top column
         names highlighted.

.. _lunch/cancel:

Cancel orders
-------------

All users can cancel an order, not only managers of the **Lunch** app.

To cancel an order from a vendor, individual products **must** be cancelled one at a time.

On the :guilabel:`Today's Orders` dashboard, a :icon:`fa-times` :guilabel:`Cancel` button is shown
at the far-right of each product line that can be cancelled. Click the :icon:`fa-times`
:guilabel:`Cancel` button to cancel the order for that individual product.

.. note::
   Only products with a red :guilabel:`Status` tag of :guilabel:`Ordered` can be cancelled.

.. image:: management/cancel.png
   :alt: Order lines with the cancel button highlighted.

.. _lunch/send-orders:

Send orders
-----------

The first step in managing the **Lunch** app is to send the orders to the vendors.

When orders are ready to be sent, the manager responsible for sending orders **must** send the
orders to the vendor, outside of the database (call, online order, etc.).

Once orders have been placed with the vendors, click the :guilabel:`Send Orders` button that appears
next to each vendor's name and phone number.

Once sent, the :guilabel:`Send Orders` button changes to a :guilabel:`Confirm Orders` button, and
the :guilabel:`Status` column is updated from red :guilabel:`Ordered` tags to blue :guilabel:`Sent`
tags, indicating the order has been sent to the vendor. Users who have placed orders in the
**Lunch** app rely on the :guilabel:`Status` tags to track their orders.

.. image:: management/send.png
   :alt: A vendor's order with the X Cancel and Send Orders buttons highlighted.

.. _lunch/confirm-orders:

Confirm orders
--------------

After orders have been sent to the vendor, the next step is to confirm the orders after they have
been delivered.

On the :guilabel:`Today's Orders` dashboard, click the :guilabel:`Confirm Orders` button that
appears next to the vendor's name and phone number.

Once confirmed, the :guilabel:`Confirm Orders` button disappears, and the :guilabel:`Status` column
is updated from blue :guilabel:`Sent` tags to green :guilabel:`Received` tags, indicating the vendor
has delivered the orders.

In addition, the :icon:`fa-times` :guilabel:`Cancel` button at the end of each product line changes
to a :icon:`fa-envelope` :guilabel:`Send Notification` button.

If needed, instead of confirming all of the individual products from a vendor, individual products
can be confirmed one at a time. To confirm an individual product, click the :icon:`fa-check`
:guilabel:`Confirm` button at the end of the individual product line. When confirming individual
products with this method, the :guilabel:`Confirm Orders` button remains on the vendor line.

.. image:: management/confirm.png
   :alt: The Today's Orders dashboard, with the two different ways to confirm an order highlighted.

.. example::
   A vendor receives an order for three pizzas, and an order of garlic knots. When the delivery is
   made to the company, the **Lunch** manager notices the garlic knots are missing.

   The manager first marks the three pizzas as received, by individually confirming the products
   with the :icon:`fa-check` :guilabel:`Confirm`  button at the end of each product line.

   Later, when the vendor delivers the garlic knots, the manager can either click the
   :icon:`fa-check` :guilabel:`Confirm`  button at the end of the line for the garlic knots, or
   click the :guilabel:`Confirm Orders` button that appears next to the vendor's name and phone
   number.

.. _lunch/notify:

Notify employees
----------------

After products are received, and the orders are confirmed, the employees **must** be informed that
their orders have been delivered, and are ready to be picked up.

Unlike sending and confirming orders, notifications must be sent individually, and cannot be sent in
a batch.

To notify the user their product has arrived, click the :icon:`fa-envelope` :guilabel:`Send
Notification` button at the end of each product line. An email is sent to the user informing them
their products have been delivered.

.. _lunch/control_vendors:

Control Vendors
===============

All orders for all vendors, both past and present, can be found in the *Control Vendors* dashboard.
To access these records, navigate to :menuselection:`Lunch app --> Manager --> Control Vendors`.

All orders appear in a list view, grouped alphabetically by :guilabel:`Vendor`. The list loads with
all vendors expanded to show all order lines for every vendor, by default.

The following information appears in the list:

- :guilabel:`Order Date`: the date the order was placed.
- :guilabel:`Vendor`: the vendor the product is being ordered from.
- :guilabel:`Product`: the specific product ordered.
- :guilabel:`Extras`: any extras selected for the product.
- :guilabel:`Notes`: any information needed to be sent to the vendor.
- :guilabel:`User`: the user who ordered the product.
- :guilabel:`Lunch Location`: where the product is set to be delivered.
- :guilabel:`Price`: the total price for the product, including all extras.
- :guilabel:`Status`: the current status of the product.
- :guilabel:`Company`: the company under which the order was placed. This only appears in a
  multi-company database.

Orders can be :ref:`cancelled <lunch/cancel>`, :ref:`sent to the vendor <lunch/send-orders>`,
:ref:`confirmed <lunch/confirm-orders>` upon arrival, and :ref:`employees can be notified
<lunch/notify>` using the same method as on the :ref:`Today's Orders <lunch/todays-orders>`
dashboard.

.. image:: management/control.png
   :alt: A list view of all the orders as seen in the Control Vendors dashboard.

.. note::
   The difference between the :ref:`Today's Orders <lunch/todays-orders>` dashboard and the
   :ref:`Control Vendors <lunch/control_vendors>` dashboard is that the *Today's Orders* dashboard
   **only** displays orders for the current day, while the :guilabel:`Control Vendors` dashboard
   displays **all** orders made in the **Lunch** app.

Orders
======

The **Lunch** app lets employees place lunch orders, see what's available each day, and check their
account balance, all from one place.

When the **Lunch** application is opened, the :guilabel:`Order Your Lunch` dashboard loads. This
view is also accessible by navigating to :menuselection:`Lunch app --> My Lunch --> New Order`.

The :guilabel:`Order Your Lunch` dashboard provides a summary of lunch offerings, the user's account
information, and the current day's orders, along with their statuses.

Order Your Lunch
================

On the main :guilabel:`Order Your Lunch` dashboard, all the necessary information needed to place an
order is visible. Enable the :guilabel:`Available Today` filter in the search bar by clicking into
the search bar and selecting :guilabel:`Available Today`. This filter shows only products that can
be purchased that day, based on the :ref:`vendor's availability <lunch/availability>`.

The left-side of the dashboard displays the various :guilabel:`Categories` of products available,
along with the :guilabel:`Vendors` supplying the products. To the right of each line is a number,
which indicates how many products are associated with that respective category or vendor.

To filter the products by categories or vendors, tick the checkbox next to the desired category or
vendor to only view items related to those selections. Multiple selections can be made in each
section.

.. note::
   If multiple selections are made, **only** products that fall under **all** the selected options
   are shown.

The top portion of the dashboard, which serves as an order summary, displays the user's account
information, and the order details for today, if any orders have been placed.

The main section, beneath the user's information, displays all the products in a default Kanban
view. Each product card displays the name, cost, vendor, photo, and description of the product. If
the product is configured as new, it also displays a :guilabel:`New` tag.

.. image:: orders/dashboard.png
   :alt: The Lunch app dashboard.

.. note::
   Anywhere a vendor's name is listed in the **Lunch** app, such as on Kanban product cards, their
   phone number is listed, as well.

The products can also be displayed in a list view, by clicking the :icon:`oi-view-list`
:guilabel:`(List)` icon in the top-right corner of the dashboard.

Placing orders
==============

To place a lunch order, navigate to the main :guilabel:`Order Your Lunch` dashboard, by either
opening the **Lunch** app, or by navigating to :menuselection:`Lunch app --> My Lunch --> New
Order`.

Add products to an order
------------------------

From the :guilabel:`Order Your Lunch` dashboard, click on a desired product to add to an order, and
the product appears in a :guilabel:`Configure Your Order` pop-up window.

At the top of the pop-up window is the product image, name, and price. Beneath that, there are
potential :guilabel:`Extras` fields, showcasing any :ref:`extra items or options <lunch/extras>`,
such as toppings or drinks. Tick the checkbox next to any desired extras present in the
:guilabel:`Extras` fields to add them to the order.

Each extra option is organized by a category, complete with its name and price. As extras are
selected, the displayed price at the top of the pop-up window updates to reflect all current
selections.

Beneath the :guilabel:`Extras` field is the :guilabel:`Description` of the product, followed by a
:guilabel:`Notes` field. The :guilabel:`Notes` field is used to enter any vital information, which
is then sent to the vendor regarding the order, such as any special requests or food allergies.

When all selections for the product have been made, click the :guilabel:`Add To Cart` button in the
lower-left of the pop-up window. To cancel the order, click the :guilabel:`Discard` button.

.. image:: orders/pizza.png
   :alt: The pop-up window for a personal pizza, with all the extras selected.

Errors
~~~~~~

Depending on how the various :ref:`extras <lunch/configure-extras>` are configured for a vendor, it
is possible to receive an error when attempting to add products to the cart.

An error can occur when a configured product **requires** the user to select an option in the
:guilabel:`Extras` field, but the user neglects to make one.

When this occurs, a :guilabel:`Validation Error` pop-up window appears. The error is briefly
explained in the pop-up window. Click :guilabel:`Close` to close the window, and make any necessary
changes to the :guilabel:`Configure Your Order` pop-up window.

.. example::
   The vendor, The Pizza Palace, provides a free beverage with any purchase. Their products are
   configured so that a beverage selection is **required** in the :guilabel:`Extras` field *before*
   adding one of their products to the cart.

   If a selection is **not** made, an error occurs. The message that appears is `You have to order
   one and only one Free Beverage with Purchase`.

   .. image:: orders/error.png
      :alt: The :guilabel:`Validation Error` pop-up window with the specific error for the free
            beverage displayed.

Your Order summary
------------------

When at least one item is added to an order, the items appear at the top of the dashboard in the
:guilabel:`Your Order` summary. In addition to the products, users can view the account information,
in addition to all the information related to orders placed during the current calendar day.

As products are added to an order, they appear at the top center of the summary box. Each product is
listed beneath the words :guilabel:`Your Order`, with the product name, quantity, and a status tag.

The available tags that can be displayed for each item are:

- :guilabel:`To Order`: the product has been added to the cart, but has not been purchased yet by
  the user.
- :guilabel:`Ordered`: the product has been purchased by the user, and is waiting to be sent to the
  vendor by a **Lunch** app manager.
- :guilabel:`Sent`: the order for the product has been sent to the vendor by a **Lunch** app
  manager.
- :guilabel:`Received`: the product has been delivered by the vendor to the user's location, and has
  been verified as received by a **Lunch** app manager.

Product quantities can be adjusted by clicking the :icon:`fa-plus` :guilabel:`(plus)` or
:icon:`fa-minus` :guilabel:`(minus)` icons to the left of the listed product. The product price
adjusts in real-time to display the cost for the currently selected quantity of the product.

The right side of the :guilabel:`Your Order` summary displays the purchasing information. The
:guilabel:`Total` amount for the entire day's lunch order is displayed. The :guilabel:`Already Paid`
field indicates how much has been paid that day towards the :guilabel:`Total` amount. The
:guilabel:`To Pay` field displays how much of the remaining :guilabel:`Total` amount must be paid,
in order to place the currently configured order.

.. image:: orders/your-order.png
   :alt: The 'Your Orders' section of the dashboard, with purchasing information.

.. tip::
   Users can place multiple orders throughout the day, and are not restricted to only placing one
   lunch order each day. Multiple orders might need to be placed, due to users forgetting to add
   items to an order, or if there are multiple meals that are available to be purchased for the
   office (not only lunch), and so on.

   Depending on the various vendors, and how the vendors and products are configured, it is possible
   to order breakfast, lunch, dinner, coffee, and/or snacks.

Submit an order
---------------

To place the order, click the :guilabel:`Order Now` button on the right-side of the :guilabel:`Your
Order` summary. The user is charged the amount that is displayed in the :guilabel:`To Pay` field,
and the cost is deducted from their **Lunch** account balance.

Once the order is placed, the tags for the purchased items in the :guilabel:`Your Order` field
change from orange :guilabel:`To Order` tags to red :guilabel:`Ordered` tags.

Track an order
--------------

When orders have been sent to the vendors, the tags for the items in the :guilabel:`Your Order`
summary change from red :guilabel:`Ordered` tags to blue :guilabel:`Sent` tags.

Once orders have been received and verified, the tags change from blue :guilabel:`Sent` tags to
green :guilabel:`Received` tags.

Receive an order
----------------

When orders are received at the delivery location, they are confirmed by a **Lunch** app manager,
and a notification is sent to the employee who ordered the food.

My Orders
=========

To view a full list of all orders placed in the **Lunch** app for the currently signed-in user,
navigate to :menuselection:`Lunch app --> My Lunch --> My Order History`. This navigates to the
:guilabel:`My Orders` dashboard. The data is filtered by :guilabel:`My Orders` and grouped by
:guilabel:`Order Date: Day`, by default, both of which are located in the search bar.

All products appear in a list view, organized by date. The list displays the :guilabel:`Order Date`,
:guilabel:`Vendor`, :guilabel:`Product`, :guilabel:`Extras`, :guilabel:`Notes`, :guilabel:`User`,
:guilabel:`Lunch Location`, :guilabel:`Price`, and :guilabel:`Status` information. If in a
multi-company database, a :guilabel:`Company` column also appears.

The total cost for each order is displayed on the line containing the order date. At the bottom of
the list, beneath all the lines, the overall total amount paid for all the orders appears, under the
:guilabel:`Price` column.

At the end of each product line with a status of :guilabel:`Ordered` or :guilabel:`Sent`, an
:guilabel:`X Cancel` button appears. Click :guilabel:`X Cancel` to cancel that product order. Once a
product order has been cancelled, the money paid for that product is refunded, and appears in the
user's account.

At the end of each product line with a status of :guilabel:`Received`, a :guilabel:`Re-order` button
appears. Click :guilabel:`Re-order` to instantly reorder that same product, with the same extras, if
applicable. The new order appears in the list, under the current date, and the product is paid for,
with money deducted from the user's account.

.. image:: orders/my-orders.png
   :alt: The list view that appears when navigating to the My Orders dashboard.

My Account
==========

To view a summary of all transactions in the user's account, navigate to :menuselection:`Lunch app
--> My Lunch --> My Account History`. Doing so reveals the :guilabel:`My Account` dashboard.

The default presentation of the :guilabel:`My Account` dashboard displays all entries, from newest
to oldest. The :guilabel:`Date`, :guilabel:`Description`, and :guilabel:`Amount` are the only fields
displayed in the list.

Entries with a negative figure listed in the :guilabel:`Amount` column represent products purchased
in the **Lunch** app. These appear in a `$-XX.XX` format.

Entries with a positive balance either represent funds added to the user's lunch account, or
cancelled orders that were eventually refunded to the user. These appear in a `$XX.XX` format.

Products
========

Odoo's **Lunch** app does *not* come with any products preconfigured. The individual products being
offered must first be configured before orders can be placed.

To add and configure products for the **Lunch** app, navigate to :menuselection:`Lunch app -->
Configuration --> Products`. Next, click the :guilabel:`New` button in the top-left corner, and a
blank product form loads.

.. _lunch/product-categories:

Product categories
==================

Product categories organize the offerings in the **Lunch** app, and allows users to filter offerings
when reviewing the menu for the day.

To add or modify categories, navigate to :menuselection:`Lunch app --> Configuration: Product
Categories`. The available categories appear in a list view.

In the **Lunch** app, there are four default categories: :guilabel:`Sandwich`, :guilabel:`Pizza`,
:guilabel:`Burger`, and :guilabel:`Drinks`.

To add a new category, click the :guilabel:`New` button in the top-left corner, and a blank category
form loads.

Enter a name in the :guilabel:`Product Category` field. If the category is company-specific and
should only appear for a certain company, select the :guilabel:`Company` from the drop-down menu.

If desired, add a photo for the category. Hover over the image box in the top-right, and click the
:icon:`fa-pencil` :guilabel:`(pencil)` icon that appears. This opens a file explorer pop-up window.
Navigate to the image, then click :guilabel:`Open`.

==================================================

====================
Manage user accounts
====================

In Odoo's **Lunch** application, users pay for products directly from their **Lunch** app account.
For funds to appear in their account, a **Lunch** app manager **must** transfer funds into each
user's account.

.. important::
   To add funds and manage user accounts, the user must have :guilabel:`Administrator` access rights
   set for the **Lunch** application. This is verified by navigating to :menuselection:`Settings app
   -->` :icon:`oi-arrow-right` :guilabel:`Manage Users`. Then, click on a user to view their various
   settings and access rights.

   For more information, refer to the :doc:`Access rights <../../general/users/access_rights/>`
   documentation.

The **Lunch** application does **not** directly interface in any way with software or products
linked to any monetary accounts or billing. Money **cannot** be transferred from users' bank
accounts, nor can users' credit cards be charged.

Odoo's **Lunch** application **only** allows for manual entries of cash exchanges that are handled
by the **Lunch** app manager. It is up to each individual company to create the method with which
lunch accounts are replenished.

.. example::
   Some examples of how money can be organized and transferred within a company:

   - Cash is handed to the **Lunch** app manager, who then updates the user's account.
   - Money is automatically deducted from the user's paychecks, then the **Lunch** app manager
     updates the account when paychecks are issued. This requires :ref:`adding a salary attachment
     <payroll/worked-days-inputs>` for the user's payslip in the *Payroll* app.
   - Companies can sell "lunch tickets" at a set price (for example, one ticket costs $5.00). Users
     can purchase tickets from a **Lunch** app manager, who then updates the user's account.

Cash Moves
==========

To add funds to user accounts, each cash move must be individually logged. To view all cash move
records, or create a new cash move, navigate to :menuselection:`Lunch app --> Manager --> Cash
Moves`. Doing so reveals the :guilabel:`Cash Moves` dashboard.

On the :guilabel:`Cash Moves` dashboard, all cash moves are presented in a default list view,
displaying each record's :guilabel:`Date`, :guilabel:`User`, :guilabel:`Description`, and
:guilabel:`Amount`. The total of all the cash moves is displayed at the bottom of the
:guilabel:`Amount` column.

Add funds
---------

To add funds to a lunch account, click the :guilabel:`New` button, located in the top-left corner of
the :guilabel:`Cash Moves` dashboard.

A blank :guilabel:`Cash Moves` form loads. Enter the following information on the form:

- :guilabel:`User`: select the user depositing cash into their account from the drop-down menu. If
  the user is not in the database, they can be created by typing their name in the :guilabel:`User`
  field, and clicking either :guilabel:`Create "user"` or :guilabel:`Create and edit...` to create
  the user and edit the :guilabel:`Create User` form.
- :guilabel:`Date`: using the calendar popover, select the date the transaction occurred.
- :guilabel:`Amount`: enter the amount being added to the lunch account.
- :guilabel:`Description`: enter a brief description of the transaction.

Control Accounts
================

An overview of every transaction in the **Lunch** app, including all cash deposits and purchases,
can be viewed on the main *Control Accounts* dashboard. To access this dashboard, navigate to
:menuselection:`Lunch app --> Manager --> Control Accounts.`

All transactions are grouped :guilabel:`By Employee`, and listed alphabetically by the user's first
name. At the end of the user's name, a number appears. This indicates the number of individual
records logged for that user.

The default view is to have all individual transactions hidden. To view all transactions for a user,
click the :icon:`fa-caret-right` :guilabel:`(triangle)` icon to the left of the desired name to
expand that specific group.

Each record includes the :guilabel:`Date`, :guilabel:`User`, :guilabel:`Description`, and
:guilabel:`Amount`.

.. important::
   This list only displays the various transactions within the **Lunch** app, and does **not** allow
   modifications to be made to any records listed.

   Cash moves can be modified, but **only** from the :ref:`Cash Moves <lunch/cash-moves>` dashboard,
   not from the :guilabel:`Control Accounts` dashboard.

   It is **not** possible to modify any product-related records.

Vendors
=======

Before :doc:`products can be added <products>` to the **Lunch** app, the restaurants that provide
the food needs to be configured.

To add a new vendor, first navigate to :menuselection:`Lunch app --> Configuration --> Vendors`.
Here, all currently configured vendors for the **Lunch** app appear in a default Kanban view. To
change to a list view, click the :icon:`oi-view-list` :guilabel:`(List)` icon in the top-right
corner.

.. note::
   No vendors are preconfigured in the **Lunch** app, so all vendors **must** be added to the
   database.

A placeholder :guilabel:`Lunch Supplier` card appears on the :guilabel:`Vendors` dashboard, by
default. Click on this card, and configure the following fields on the vendor form:

- :ref:`Vendor information <lunch/vendor-info>`
- :ref:`Availability <lunch/availability>`
- :ref:`Orders <lunch/orders>`
- :ref:`Extras <lunch/extras>`

After the first vendor is configured, add more vendors by clicking the :guilabel:`New` button in the
top-left corner, and configure the new lunch supplier form. Repeat for all needed vendors.

.. _lunch/vendor-info:

Vendor information
==================

- :guilabel:`Vendor`: Enter a name for the vendor in this field.
- :guilabel:`Vendor` (beneath the line for vendor name): Using the drop-down menu, select the
  corresponding vendor in the **Contacts** app. If the vendor has not already been created, type in
  the vendor name, and click :guilabel:`Create "new vendor name"` to add them. Alternatively, click
  :guilabel:`Create and edit...` to create the vendor and edit the vendor contact form. The vendor
  contact form allows for more details to be entered, such as contact information.

  .. note::
     If a selection is made to the drop-down :guilabel:`Vendor` field, the :guilabel:`Vendor` text
     field (above, for the vendor's name) updates with the name of the vendor chosen from the
     drop-down menu.

     The list of vendors that is presented in the drop-down menu is pulled from the **Contacts**
     application.

- :guilabel:`Address`: Enter the vendor's address in the various fields.
- :guilabel:`Email`: Enter the vendor's email in this field.
- :guilabel:`Phone`: Enter the vendor's phone number in this field.
- :guilabel:`Company`: If this vendor is only available to a specific company, select the company
  from the drop-down menu. If this field is left blank, the vendor's items are available to **all**
  companies. This field **only** appears in a multi-company database.

.. image:: vendors/vendor-info.png

.. _lunch/availability:

Availability
============

The :guilabel:`AVAILABILITY` section presents a table with two rows. The days of the week populate
the top row, and the bottom row has checkboxes. Tick the corresponding checkbox for each day of the
week the vendor is available.

By default, Monday through Friday are ticked.

.. image:: vendors/availability.png
   :alt: The default view of the availability section, with Mon-Fri enabled.

.. _lunch/orders:

Orders
======

The :guilabel:`ORDERS` section of the vendor form details which locations the vendor is available
for, in addition to how and when orders are placed and received.

- :guilabel:`Delivery`: Using the drop-down menu, select :guilabel:`Delivery` if the vendor delivers
  to the office, or select :guilabel:`No Delivery` if orders must be picked up.
- :guilabel:`Location`: Select which locations are able to order from this vendor. Multiple
  locations can be selected. If this field is left blank, **all** locations can order from the
  vendor.

  .. note::
     An `HQ Office` location is created by default when creating a database, and is available to
     select from the list.

- :guilabel:`Send Order By`: Click the radio button to select how orders are sent to the vendor. The
  available options are :guilabel:`Phone` or :guilabel:`Email`.
- :guilabel:`Order Time`: This field **only** appears if :guilabel:`Email` is selected in the
  :guilabel:`Send Order By` field. Enter the time that an order must be emailed for it to be
  accepted. Enter the time in the following format: `HH:MM`. Then select either :guilabel:`AM` or
  :guilabel:`PM` from the drop-down menu, next to the time field.

.. _lunch/extras:

Extras
======

When ordering an item in the **Lunch** app, optional extra items, sometimes referred to as
*add-ons*, can be shown. These can be configured in any manner that suits the products being
offered.

By default, Odoo allows for three types of extra items, which can be thought of as *categories*. By
default, the first type (or *category*) of add-ons is labeled `Extras`, the second is labeled
`Beverages`, and the third is labeled `Extra Label 3`.

.. important::
   When configuring the extras, it is important to keep in mind that all the extras configured
   appear for **every item** offered by the vendor. That means that only items which apply to
   **all** products from the vendor should be added.

.. _lunch/configure-extras:

Configure extras
----------------

Enter the following information for each of the three available extra sections:

- :guilabel:`Extra (#) Label`: Enter a name for the type of extra, such as `Toppings`. This can be
  thought of as a *category*.
- :guilabel:`Extra (#) Quantity`: Select how the extras are selected. The options are:

  - :guilabel:`None or More`: Select this option if the user is not required to make a selection.
  - :guilabel:`One or More`: Select this option to **require** the user to make **at least one**
    selection.
  - :guilabel:`Only One`: Select this option to **require** the user to make **only one** selection.

Add extras
----------

After the labels and quantities have been configured for an extra category, the individual extra
items must be added for each category.

Click :guilabel:`Add a line` at the bottom of the list that appears on the right-hand side of the
extra category. Enter the :guilabel:`Name` and :guilabel:`Price` for each item being added. The
price can remain at `$0.00` if there is no cost. This is common for items like disposable silverware
or condiments.

.. example::
   For a pizzeria that only offers personal pizzas, see their extras configured as follows:

   The first extra is configured for the various toppings they offer. The :guilabel:`Extra 1 Label`
   is set to `Toppings`, and the :guilabel:`Extra 1 Quantity` is set to :guilabel:`None or More`.
   The various toppings are then added, with their corresponding costs.

   .. image:: vendors/extras.png
      :alt: The first of the extras configured for pizza toppings.

   The pizzeria also offers a free beverage with any purchase. To set this up, the :guilabel:`Extra
   2 Label` is set to `Beverages`, and the :guilabel:`Extra 2 Quantity` is set to :guilabel:`Only
   One`. The various beverage choices are added, and the cost for each remains zero.

   .. image:: vendors/beverages.png
      :alt: The second of the extras configured for a free beverage with purchase.

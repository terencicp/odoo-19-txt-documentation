Odoo **Employees** centralizes :doc:`personnel files <employees/new_employee>`, employment
:doc:`contracts <payroll/contracts>`, and :doc:`departmental hierarchies <employees/departments>` in
one system. Properly configuring its settings ensures the dashboard shows each employee's real-time
attendance and work location—data that drives payroll accuracy, capacity planning, and compliance
reporting.

Settings
========

To view and configure the available settings, navigate to :menuselection:`Employees app -->
Configuration --> Settings`.

Employees
---------

- :guilabel:`Presence Display`: select how the employee's availability status is calculated.

  - :guilabel:`Based on attendances`: marked available when :ref:`checked into <attendances/check-in>`
    the **Attendances** app.
  - :guilabel:`Based on user status in system`: marked available when the :doc:`employee logs in to
    Odoo <attendances/check_in_check_out>`.

- :guilabel:`Advanced Presence Control`: when enabled, presence status can be calculated from
  operational signals rather than check-ins or logins:

  - :guilabel:`Based on number of emails sent`: an employee is marked present if they send at least
    # emails per hour; otherwise, they are marked absent. Enter the minimum number of emails that
    must be sent in the :guilabel:`Sent Emails` field.
  - :guilabel:`Based on IP Address`: an employee is marked present only when connected from one of
    the specified corporate IP addresses. Enter the IP addresses in the :guilabel:`IP Addresses`
    field, separating each address with a comma.

- :guilabel:`Skills Management`: enable this option to display the :ref:`resumé tab <employees/resume>`
  on employee profiles. This allows for the display of :ref:`work experience <employees/resume>`,
  :ref:`skills <employees/skills>`, and :doc:`certifications <employees/certifications>`.
- :guilabel:`Remote Work`: enable this option to allow for a detailed schedule to appear on the
  employee form, in the :ref:`Work Information <employees/work-info-tab>` tab. When enabled, the
  specific location can be set for each working day for the employee. The corresponding icon is
  displayed in the upper-right corner of the employee card, indicating their location by icon, and
  status by color.

  .. example::
     A green :icon:`fa-home` :guilabel:`(home)` icon indicates the employee is working from home
     that day. A :icon:`fa-building` :guilabel:`(building)` icon means the employee is scheduled to
     work at the office.

     The *color* of the icon indicates the employee's status, with green indicating present, yellow
     indicating absent, and gray indicating it is outside of the employee's working hours.

     .. image:: employees/presence.png

are :guilabel:`Standard 40 hours/week`, :guilabel:`Appointment Resource Default Calendar`, and
:guilabel:`Standard 32 hours/week (4 work days, Friday free)`.

The available working hours listed are the same as the configured :doc:`working schedules
<payroll/working_schedules>` in the **Payroll** app. Working hours can be created and modified from
both the **Payroll** and **Employees** apps.

Employee update rights

======
Badges
======

In Odoo, employees can earn badges, either automatically through :doc:`challenges created in the CRM
app <../../sales/crm/optimize/gamification>`, through **eLearning** courses, or manually, as
managers decide to award them.

Badges are a way to gamify the work day, can be created for any reason, and can be granted to any
user.

.. important::
   Badges can **only** be awarded to :doc:`users of the database <../../general/users>`, *and* if
   the **eLearning** app is installed.

View available badges
=====================

To view the available badges that are configured by default, navigate to :menuselection:`Employees
app --> Configuration --> Badges`.

All badges appear in a default Kanban view, with the badge's :guilabel:`Name` and image displayed.
Additionally, the number of users awarded the badge for both the current month, and in total,
appears, along with the badge description, and the avatar for each user who received the badge.

Each badge has a :guilabel:`Grant` button to :ref:`award the badge <employees/grant_badge>` from the
:guilabel:`Badges` dashboard.

.. image:: badges/badges.png
   :alt: All the available badges, on the Badges dashboard.

Create badges
=============

Badges can be created in the database when the default badges are not sufficient. This can be done
from the :guilabel:`Badges` dashboard in the **Employees** app, or from the **CRM** app.

To add a badge in the **Employees** app, first navigate to :menuselection:`Employees app -->
Configuration --> Badges`, then click the :guilabel:`New` button in the upper-left corner.

Fill out the badge form as outlined in the :ref:`CRM documentation <crm/create-rewards>`.

.. seealso::
   :ref:`CRM Gamification <crm/create-rewards>`

View employee badges
====================

To view badges awarded to an employee, open the **Employees** app, and click on an employee record.
Click on the :guilabel:`Received Badges` tab to view any awarded badges.

.. note::
   If this tab is not visible, it means there is no :guilabel:`Related User` in the
   :guilabel:`Settings` tab. Once a user is populated in the :guilabel:`Related User` field, the
   :guilabel:`Badges` tab appears.

.. _employees/grant_badge:

Grant badges
============

To grant a badge to an employee, open the employee record, and click into the :guilabel:`Received
Badges` tab. Click the :guilabel:`Grant a Badge` button to load a :guilabel:`Reward Employee` pop-up
window.

Using the drop-down menu, select the badge being awarded in the :guilabel:`What are you thankful
for?` field. The default options are :guilabel:`Good Job`, :guilabel:`Problem Solver`, and
:guilabel:`Brilliant`.

.. note::
   Additional options appear (e.g., :guilabel:`Get Started`, :guilabel:`Power user`,
   :guilabel:`community Hero`) which are associated with challenges. These are automatically granted
   through completed challenges. While these can be awarded at any time, it is advised to grant
   badges manually that are *not* associated with a challenge.

Next, enter a brief summary of why the badge is being granted in the field displaying
:guilabel:`Describe what they did and why it matters (will be public)` field. Last, click the
:guilabel:`Reward Employee` button, and the badge is awarded, and is visible in the
:guilabel:`Badges` tab.

.. note::
   Users cannot grant themselves badges. An error message appears if attempted.

SECTION: certifications.rst
PATH: applications/hr/employees/certifications.rst
==================================================

==============
Certifications
==============

When jobs require specific knowledge, it is necessary to track employee certifications to ensure the
necessary knowledge and certifications are in place.

When jobs require specific knowledge, track employee certifications (e.g., classes, tests, seminars)
to verify required skills. Odoo accepts any certification type without restriction.

.. important::
   To add certifications to an employee profile, and to access the *Employee Certifications* report,
   the **Surveys** app **must** be installed.

View certifications
===================

To view a full list of all employee certifications, navigate to :menuselection:`Employees app -->
Reporting --> Certifications`.

All certifications appear in a list view, grouped by employee. Each certification entry displays the
following:

- :guilabel:`Employee`: the employee's name, along with their avatar image.
- :guilabel:`Name`: the title of the certification.
- :guilabel:`Validity Start`: when the employee received the certification.
- :guilabel:`Validity End`: when the certification expires.
- :guilabel:`Certification`: the corresponding course in the **Surveys** app that was completed by
  the employee, if applicable.

The entries are also color-coded. Current certifications that are still valid appear in black,
expired certifications appear in red, and certifications that are going to expire within the next 90
days appear in orange.

.. image:: certifications/certifications.png
   :alt: The list of employee certifications.

.. important::
   **Only** certification records with the *Display Type* set to *Certification* on their
   :ref:`certification form <employees/certifications-form>` appear on the :guilabel:`Employee
   Certifications` report. All other certifications appear in the resume section of the
   :ref:`employee form <employees/resume>`.

View certifications by expiration status
----------------------------------------

When managing a large number of employees with a variety of certifications, it can be difficult to
determine which employees need to keep necessary certifications current in the default list view. In
this scenario, it is beneficial to view the certifications by expiration status.

To do so, navigate to :menuselection:`Employees app --> Reporting --> Certifications`. Next, click
the :icon:`fa-caret-down` :guilabel:`(Toggle Search Panel)` icon in the search bar, then click
:guilabel:`Add Custom Group`  :icon:`fa-caret-down`, revealing a drop-down menu. Click
:guilabel:`Expiration Status`, then click away from the drop-down menu to close it.

After doing so, all the certifications are organized by status, starting with :guilabel:`Expired`
certifications, then certifications that are :guilabel:`Expiring` soon (within the next 90 days),
and lastly, certifications that are still :guilabel:`Valid`.

Filter certifications by expiration status to identify certifications expiring soon, and identify
employees who must renew.

.. image:: certifications/status.png
   :alt: The list of employee certifications, grouped by status.

.. _employees/certifications-form:

Log a certification
===================

To log a certification for an employee, navigate to :menuselection:`Employees app --> Learning -->

information on the form:

- :guilabel:`Title`: Enter a short description for the certification in this field.
- :guilabel:`Employee`: Using the drop-down menu, select the employee who received the
  certification.
- :guilabel:`Type`: Using the drop-down menu, select the type of certification received. This field
  determines where on the employee's resume the certification appears. To create a new
  :guilabel:`Type`, enter the type in the field, then click :guilabel:`Create [type]`.

  The default options are:

  - :guilabel:`Experience`: Select this option to have the certification appear in the *Experience*
    section of the *Resume* tab on the :doc:`employee form <new_employee>`. Experience entries are
    typically previous jobs or internships.
  - :guilabel:`Education`: Select this option to have the certification appear in the *Education*
    section of the *Resume* tab on the :doc:`employee form <new_employee>`.
  - :guilabel:`Social Media`: Select this option to have the certification appear in the *Social
    Media* section of the *Resume* tab on the :doc:`employee form <new_employee>`. Social Media
    entries typically relate to certifications relating to digital marketing, social media
    management, and specific trainings from social media platforms.
  - :guilabel:`Internal Certification`: Select this option to have the certification appear in the
    *Internal Certification* section of the *Resume* tab on the :doc:`employee form <new_employee>`.
    Internal certifications entries are tied to courses, training, or programs created by the
    company, that once completed, have a certification associated with it.
  - :guilabel:`Completed Internal Training`: Select this option to have the certification appear in
    the *Completed Internal Training* section of the *Resume* tab on the :doc:`employee form
    <new_employee>`. Completed internal training entries are typically associated with trainings
    created by the company, for company-specific processes. These do not result in any
    certifications, but are logged on the employee profile to indicate completed training.

- :guilabel:`Display Type`: Select the visibility of the certification in this field. The default
  options are:

  - :guilabel:`Classic`: Select this option to have the certification appear in the *Resume* section
    of the employee form, and **not** appear on the *Employee Certifications* report.
  - :guilabel:`Certification`: select this option to have the certification appear in the *Resume*
    section of the employee form, **and** appear on the *Employee Certifications* report. Once this
    is selected, a :guilabel:`Certification` field appears beneath the :guilabel:`Display Type`
    field. Using the drop-down menu, select the corresponding **Surveys** app certification the
    employee took. This field **only** appears if the **Surveys** app is installed.
  - :guilabel:`Course`: Select this option to have the certification appear in the *Resume* section
    of the employee form, and **not** appear on the *Employee Certifications* report. Once this
    option is selected, a :guilabel:`Course` field appears beneath the :guilabel:`Display Type`
    field. Using the drop-down menu, select the corresponding **eLearning** course the employee
    took. This field **only** appears if the **eLearning** app is installed.

- :guilabel:`Description`: Enter a description for the certification in this field.
- :guilabel:`Duration`: Click into the first field, and a calendar pop-over window appears. Click on
  the start and end dates for the certification validity period. When the correct dates are
  selected, click :icon:`fa-check` :guilabel:`Apply`, and both fields are populated.

.. note::
   Once a certification is logged for an employee, a new certification of the *same type* (i.e.
   :guilabel:`Education` or  :guilabel:`Internal Certification`) can be added directly from the
   employee form, instead of the :guilabel:`Employee Certifications` dashboard.

   In the main **Employees** app dashboard, click on an employee profile to open their employee
   form. In the :guilabel:`RESUME` tab, click the :guilabel:`ADD` button at the end of the
   corresponding certification line.

   This :guilabel:`ADD` button **only** appears on employee profiles that already have a
   certification.

Equipment
=========

Many employees are given various items to use while they work, such as laptops, phones, and
printers. Most companies track their equipment, to see who is using what, as well as having a record
of important information regarding the equipment, such as serial numbers, warranty information, and
maintenance history.

.. note::
   To track employee equipment, the **Maintenance** app *must* be installed.

.. _employees/equipment:

Individual employee equipment
=============================

Employee equipment is tracked on the employee record. To view all equipment currently assigned to an
employee, navigate to the :menuselection:`Employees` app, and click on the desired employee record.

At the top of the record, an :icon:`fa-cubes` :guilabel:`Equipment Count` smart button appears, with
a number indicating how many, if any, items are currently assigned to that employee.

Click the :icon:`fa-cubes` :guilabel:`Equipment Count` smart button, and all equipment currently
assigned to the employee appears in individual Kanban cards.

Each Kanban card displays the equipment's name and model on the first line, followed by the serial
number (if available), and lastly, the employee's name. Any current maintenance requests appear at
the bottom of the card in a red box.

.. image:: equipment/equipment.png
   :alt: A Kanban view of all equipment for an employee.

.. note::
   A serial number is **not** required when logging equipment.

All employee equipment
======================

To view all equipment for all employees, start on the :ref:`equipment record of an individual
employee <employees/equipment>`.

.. note::
   It does not matter what employee is selected, or whether they have any equipment assigned to
   them. This step is only used to get to the :guilabel:`Equipment` list.

In the Kanban view of the employee's equipment, clear the default :guilabel:`Assigned Employee`
filter in the search bar. This presents *all* equipment in the database, including those assigned to
individual employees and whole departments.

Click into the search bar, and select :guilabel:`Employee` in the :icon:`oi-group` :guilabel:`Group
By` column. The equipment is now organized in a Kanban view, by employee.

In the Kanban view displaying all employee equipment records, equipment can be reassigned by
clicking and dragging an equipment card to the desired employee. This changes ownership of the
equipment.

.. image:: equipment/all-equipment.png
   :alt: A Kanban view of all equipment for all employees.

Add equipment to an employee record
===================================

To add equipment to an employee's record, open the :menuselection:`Employees` app, click on the
desired employee record, then click the :icon:`fa-cubes` :guilabel:`Equipment Count` smart button at
the top.

All equipment currently assigned to the employee appears in individual Kanban cards. To add a new
equipment record, click the :guilabel:`New` button in the upper-left corner, and a blank
:guilabel:`Equipment` form loads.

:doc:`Fill out the equipment form <../../inventory_and_mrp/maintenance/add_new_equipment>` for the
employee's equipment.

.. tip::
   Instead of filling out a new :guilabel:`Equipment` form for the same item, a form can be
   duplicated, then updated.

   On the :guilabel:`Equipment` form, click the :icon:`fa-gear` :guilabel:`(Actions)` icon in the
   upper-left corner, then select :icon:`fa-clone` :guilabel:`Duplicate`.

   An identical form appears, with *all* the information filled out, except for the
   :guilabel:`Serial Number`.

PATH: applications/hr/employees/new_employee.rst
==================================================

=============
New employees
=============

When a new employee is hired, the first step is to create a new employee record. This record is a
centralized place where all important information about the employee is stored, including
:ref:`general information <employees/general-info>`, :ref:`job history and skills
<employees/resume>`, :ref:`various work information <employees/work-info-tab>`, :ref:`personal
details <employees/private-info>`, :ref:`payroll-related information <employees/payroll>`, and
various :ref:`settings <employees/hr-settings>` that affect integrations with other apps in the
database.

To begin, open the :menuselection:`Employees` app, then click the :guilabel:`New` button in the
upper-left corner. Doing so reveals a blank employee form.

Proceed to fill out the required information, along with any additional details.

.. image:: new_employee/new-employee-form.png
   :alt: Create a new employee form with all fields filled out.

.. note::
   The current company phone number and name are populated in the :guilabel:`Work Phone` and
   :guilabel:`Company` fields. If the **Appraisals** application is installed, the :guilabel:`Next
   Appraisal Date` field is populated with a date six months from the current date.

.. _employees/general-info:

General information
===================

Fill out the following employee details.

.. tip::
   The employee form automatically saves as data is entered. However, the form can be saved manually
   at any time by clicking the :icon:`fa-cloud-upload` :guilabel:`(Save manually)` icon.

- :guilabel:`Employee's Name`: enter the employee's name. This field is required.
- :guilabel:`Job Position`: this field appears below the employee name and can be filled in
  manually. Alternatively, select a position from the drop-down menu in the :guilabel:`Job Position`
  field beneath the :guilabel:`Department` field to auto-populate the top field. The two fields do
  not need to match.

  .. example::
     While it is recommended to have the job positions match, the typed-in description in this top
     field can contain more specific information than the selected drop-down :guilabel:`Job
     Position`, if desired.

     For instance, if someone is hired for a sales representative position configured as
     :guilabel:`Sales Representative` in the **Recruitment** app, that can be selected in the
     drop-down :guilabel:`Job Position` field.

     In the typed-in :guilabel:`Job Position` field beneath the :guilabel:`Employee's Name`, the
     position can be more specific, such as `Sales Representative - Subscriptions` if the employee
     is focused solely on subscription sales.

     .. image:: new_employee/job-description-fields.png
        :alt: Both job position fields entered but with different information.

- :guilabel:`Photo`: in the top-right image box of the employee form, click on the :icon:`fa-pencil`
  :guilabel:`(Edit)` icon, then select a photo to upload.
- *Work Contact Information*: enter the employee's :guilabel:`Work Email`, :guilabel:`Work Phone`,
  and :guilabel:`Work Mobile`,  information, if not already auto-populated.
- :guilabel:`Tags`: select a tag from the drop-down menu to add relevant tags to the employee. Any
  tag can be created in this field by typing it in. Once created, the new tag is available for all
  employee records. There is no limit to the amount of tags that can be added on an employee form.
- :guilabel:`Company`: from the drop-down menu in this field, select the company the new employee
  was hired by, or create a new company by typing the name in the field, and clicking
  :guilabel:`Create` or :guilabel:`Create and edit...` from the mini drop-down menu that appears.
  This field is required.
- :guilabel:`Department`: select the employee's department from the drop-down menu.

.. _employees/skills:

Skills
------

An employee's skills can be entered in the :guilabel:`Resumé` tab in the same manner that a resumé
line is created.

In order to add a skill to an employee record, the skill types must first be configured. By default,
Odoo comes with two :guilabel:`Skill Types` preconfigured: *Languages* and *Soft Skills*.
:ref:`Configure the rest of the skill types <employees/skill-types>` before adding any skills to the
employee record.

When adding the first skill to an employee record, a :guilabel:`Pick a skill from the list` button
appears in the :guilabel:`Skills` section of the :guilabel:`Resumé` tab. Click the :guilabel:`Pick a
skill from the list` button, and select the following information for each skill.

- :guilabel:`Skill Type`: select a :ref:`skill type <employees/skill-types>` by clicking the radio
  button next to the skill type.
- :guilabel:`Skill`: after selecting a :guilabel:`Skill Type`, the corresponding skills associated
  with that selected :guilabel:`Skill Type` appear in a drop-down menu. For example, selecting
  :guilabel:`Language` as the :guilabel:`Skill Type` presents a variety of languages to select from
  under the :guilabel:`Skills` field. Select the appropriate preconfigured skill from the list.

  .. important::
     If the desired skill does not appear in the list, it is **not** possible to add the new skill
     from this window. New skills must be added from the :ref:`Skill Types <employees/skill-types>`
     dashboard.

- :guilabel:`Skill Level`: pre-defined skill levels associated with the selected :guilabel:`Skill
  Type` appear in a drop-down menu. First, select a :guilabel:`Skill Level`, then the progress bar
  automatically displays the pre-defined progress for that specific skill level. Skill levels can be
  created and modified from the :ref:`Skill Types <employees/skill-types>` dashboard.

Click the :guilabel:`Save & Close` button if there is only one skill to add, or click the
:guilabel:`Save & New` button to save the current entry and immediately add another skill.

At any point, a new line can be added by clicking the :guilabel:`ADD` button next to the
corresponding section.

When an employee leaves the company, it is important to have an :ref:`offboarding plan
<employees/offboarding>` to ensure all necessary steps are followed, such as returning equipment,
revoking access to business systems, filling out HR forms, having an exit interview, and more.
Depending on the company, there could be several different offboarding plans, configured for
specific departments or divisions, that have different requirements and steps from the main
offboarding plan.

In addition to an offboarding plan, the employee record must be :ref:`updated to reflect their
departure <employees/archive>`, log the reason why they left, close any open activities associated
with the employee, and :ref:`provide them with any important documents <employees/send-link>`.

.. _employees/offboarding:

view the detailed offboarding plan form.

Offboarding plan steps
----------------------

The default :guilabel:`Offboarding` plan is minimal, with two default steps (three if the **Fleet**
app is installed). All steps are :guilabel:`To-Do` activities, and are scheduled for the day the
offboarding plan is launched (:guilabel:`0 days Before Plan Date`).

- :guilabel:`Organize knowledge transfer inside the team`: The manager must ensure all knowledge the
  employee has relating to their job position, is either documented or shared with colleagues so
  there is no knowledge gap.
- :guilabel:`Take Back Fleet`: The fleet manager ensures any vehicles assigned to the employee are
  either unassigned (available for other employees) or the next driver is assigned. This step only
  appears if the **Fleet** app is installed.
- :guilabel:`Take Back HR Materials`: The manager must obtain any documents and materials the HR
  department requires. It is recommended to check with the HR department to ensure everything

   :alt: The three default steps in the Offboarding plan.

Modify offboarding plan
=======================

The default offboarding plan is minimal, so that modifications can be made to accommodate any
company's offboarding needs. Every company has different requirements, therefore it is necessary to
add the required steps to the offboarding plan.

If the offboarding plan is universal, add or modify the default offboarding plan. If the offboarding
plan needed is only for a specific department, then a new plan should be created, specifically for
that department.

To modify the default plan, first navigate to :menuselection:`Employees app --> Configuration -->
Activity Plan`, then click on :guilabel:`Offboarding`.

To modify a step, click on the step and an :guilabel:`Open: Activities` pop-up window appears. Make
any desired modifications to the step, then click :guilabel:`Save` to accept the changes and close
the pop-up window.

To add a new step, click :guilabel:`Add a line` at the bottom of the listed activities in the
:guilabel:`Activities To Create` tab, and a blank :guilabel:`Create Activities` pop-up window
appears. Enter all the information in the pop-up window, then click :guilabel:`Save & Close` if
there are no other steps to add, or click :guilabel:`Save & New` if more steps are needed.

Configure all the desired steps for the offboarding plan.

Create offboarding plan
=======================

For some companies, specific offboarding plans may be necessary for some departments. For these
cases, a new department-specific offboarding plan may be needed.

To create a new offboarding plan, first navigate to :menuselection:`Employees app -->
Configuration --> Activity Plan`. Click the :guilabel:`New` button in the upper-left corner, and a
blank plan form loads.

Enter the following information on the form:

- :guilabel:`Plan Name`: the specific name for the plan.
- :guilabel:`Model`: This field specifies where this plan can be used. In this case, in the
  **Employees** app. This field is not able to be modified.
- :guilabel:`Department`: if left blank (the default setting) the plan is available for all
  departments. To make the plan department-specific, select a department using the drop-down menu.

Next, add the various steps for the plan by clicking :guilabel:`Add a line` at the bottom of the
listed activities in the :guilabel:`Activities To Create` tab, and a blank :guilabel:`Create
Activities` pop-up window appears.

Enter the following information in the pop-up window:

- :guilabel:`Activity Type`: Using the drop-down menu, select the specific activity to be scheduled.
  The default options are :guilabel:`Email`, :guilabel:`Call`, :guilabel:`Meeting`,
  :guilabel:`To-Do`, or :guilabel:`Upload Document`. If the **Sign** app is installed, a
  :guilabel:`Request Signature` option is available.
- :guilabel:`Summary`: Enter a short description for the step.
- :guilabel:`Assignment`: Using the drop-down menu, select the person assigned to perform the
  activity. The default options are: :guilabel:`Ask at launch`, :guilabel:`Default user`,
  :guilabel:`Coach`, :guilabel:`Manager`, and :guilabel:`Employee`. If the **Fleet** app is
  installed, a :guilabel:`Fleet Manager` option is available.

  .. note::
     The selection for the :guilabel:`Assignment` role is in relation to the employee. If
     :guilabel:`Coach` is selected, the employee's coach is assigned to the activity.

     If :guilabel:`Default user` is selected, an :guilabel:`Assigned to` field appears. Using the
     drop-down menu, select the user who will always be assigned this activity.

- :guilabel:`Interval`: Configure the fields in this line to determine the due date of the activity.
  Enter a number in the first field, then, using the drop-down menus in the following two fields,
  configure when the due date should be created; (`#`) of :guilabel:`days`, :guilabel:`weeks`, or
  :guilabel:`months`, either :guilabel:`Before Plan Date` or :guilabel:`After Plan Date`.

When the :guilabel:`Create Activities` for is completed, click :guilabel:`Save & Close` if there are
no other steps to add, or click :guilabel:`Save & New` to add more steps, as needed.

.. example::
   A company specializing in after-school art programs has two separate offboarding plans, one for
   the teachers working in the field, and one for office workers.

   The offboarding plan for the teachers is set for the :guilabel:`Art Program Teachers` department,
   and includes specialized tasks relating to those jobs. These include ensuring all art supplies
   are catalogued and returned, all student feedback forms are turned in, and all access badges and
   keys for the various locations are returned.

   .. image:: offboarding/offboarding-teachers.png
      :alt: An offboarding plan configured for art teachers.

Launch offboarding plan
=======================

After an employee has given notice (typically two weeks) or once the company has decided to
terminate the working relationship with the employee, the offboarding plan should be launched.
Navigate to the :menuselection:`Employees app` and click on the departing employee profile. Click
the :guilabel:`Launch Plan` button, and a blank :guilabel:`Launch Plan` pop-up window loads.

.. image:: offboarding/launch-plan-button.png
   :alt: The Launch Plan button on the employee profile.

Using the drop-down menu, select the desired offboarding plan in the :guilabel:`Plan` field. Then,
using the calendar selector, set a date in the :guilabel:`Plan Date` field. This is typically the
day the employee gave notice, but any date can be selected.

The right-side of the :guilabel:`Launch Plan` pop-up window displays all the steps in the selected
plan, grouped by what was selected in the :guilabel:`Assignment` fields for the various plan steps.

Once the :guilabel:`Plan` and :guilabel:`Plan Date` fields are configured, click the
:guilabel:`Schedule` button, and Odoo schedules everything in the plan, according to their
respective due dates. All scheduled activities appear in the chatter of the employee profile.

.. _employees/archive:

Archive an employee
===================

In Odoo, when an employee leaves the company they must be *archived*. This step should be done
*after* the employee has been fully offboarded. To archive an employee, first navigate to the
:menuselection:`Employees app`. From here, locate the employee who is leaving the company, and click
on their employee card.

The employee form loads, displaying all their information. Click the :icon:`fa-gear`
:guilabel:`(gear)` icon in the top-left corner, and a drop-down menu appears. Click
:icon:`oi-archive` :guilabel:`Archive`, and an :guilabel:`Employee Termination` pop-up window
appears.

Fill out the following fields on the form:

- :guilabel:`Departure Reason`: Select a reason the employee is leaving from the drop-down menu. The
  default options are:

  - :guilabel:`Fired`: Select this option when an employee is being let go, and the company has
    given notice.
  - :guilabel:`Resigned`: Select this option when the employee no longer wishes to be employed, and
    the employee has given notice.
  - :guilabel:`Resigned: Retired`: Select this option when the employee is retiring.
  - :guilabel:`Became Freelance`: Select this option when the employee is no longer working for the
    company, but is becoming a freelance worker instead.
  - :guilabel:`Mutual Agreement`: Select this option when both parties have agreed to terminate
    their working relationship.

- :guilabel:`Contract End Date`: Using the calendar selector, select the last day the employee is
  working for the company.
- :guilabel:`Detailed Reason`: Enter a short description for the employee's departure in this field.
- :guilabel:`Close Activities`: Tick the checkbox next to each type of activity to close or delete
  any open activities associated with it. It is recommended to tick **all** checkboxes that are
  applicable. The available options are:

  - :guilabel:`Appraisals`: cancels all appraisals scheduled after the contract end date.
  - :guilabel:`Contract`: applies an end date for the current contract.
  - :guilabel:`Company Car`: removes the employee as the driver for their current company car, and
    :ref:`assigns the next driver <fleet/new_vehicle/new-driver>`, if applicable.
  - :guilabel:`Equipment`: unassigns the employee from any assigned equipment.

- :guilabel:`HR Info`: Tick the checkbox next to :guilabel:`Send Access Link` to send a download
  link to the employee's personal email address, containing all their personal HR files.
- :guilabel:`Private Email`: This field appears if the :guilabel:`HR Info` checkbox is ticked. If
  there is a private email listed on the employee profile, this field is automatically populated. If
  no private email address is on their record, enter the private email address for the employee.

When the form is complete, click :guilabel:`Apply`. The employee record is archived, an email with a
download link to their personal documents is sent to the employee's private email address (if
selected), and a red :guilabel:`Archived` banner appears in the top-right corner of the employee
form. The chatter logs the :guilabel:`Departure Date` and :guilabel:`Departure Reason`, and if an
access link was emailed.

.. image:: offboarding/termination.png
   :alt: The employee termination form with all fields filled out.

.. note::
   While attempting to send the HR documents access link, an :guilabel:`Invalid Operation` pop-up
   window may appear, displaying the following error message:

   :guilabel:`Employee's related user and private email must be set to use "Send Access Link"
   function: (Employee Name)`

   If this error appears, click :guilabel:`Close` to close the pop-up window, then tick the
   :guilabel:`Send Access Link` checkbox to deselect it on the :guilabel:`Employee Termination`
   pop-up window.

   Click :guilabel:`Apply` to archive the employee and close the selected activities on the
   :guilabel:`Employee Termination` pop-up window, returning to the employee form.

   Once the employee form, ensure the following fields are populated:

   - :guilabel:`Private Information` tab: Ensure an email address is entered in the
     :guilabel:`Email` field.
   - :guilabel:`HR Settings` tab: Ensure a :guilabel:`Related User` is selected in the corresponding
     field.

   After the necessary information is entered, :ref:`resend the HR documents access link
   <employees/send-link>`

.. _employees/send-link:

Send HR documents access link
-----------------------------

If the access link was not sent when first archiving the employee on the *Employee Termination*
form, it can be sent after the employee is archived at any point.

After an employee is archived, they are no longer visible on the main **Employees** app dashboard.
To view the archived employees, navigate to the :menuselection:`Employees app` dashboard, and click
the :icon:`fa-caret-down` :guilabel:`(down arrow)` in the search bar to reveal a drop-down menu.
Select :guilabel:`Archived`, towards the bottom of the :icon:`fa-filter` :guilabel:`Filters` column,
then click away from the drop-down window to close it.

Now, only archived employees appear on the dashboard. Click on the desired employee to open their
employee form. On this form, click the :icon:`fa-gear` :guilabel:`(gear)` icon in the top-left
corner, then click :guilabel:`Send HR Documents Access Link` from the resulting drop-down menu. The
chatter logs that the link was sent.

==========
Onboarding
==========

When a new employee is hired, it is important to have an onboarding procedure that can be followed.
This ensures that information, equipment, and training are provided to the employee and any other
necessary steps for the business are assigned to the correct individuals.

Proper onboarding ensures that new employees are given all the information and tools needed to be
successful in their roles and have a smooth transition to their new job.

View onboarding plan
====================

Before onboarding can begin, it is recommended to check the default onboarding plan that comes
preconfigured with the **Employees** app. To view the current default plan, navigate to
:menuselection:`Employees app --> Configuration --> Activity Plan`. Click :guilabel:`Onboarding` to
view the detailed onboarding plan form.

.. _onboarding/plan-form:

The plan form displays the following information:

- :guilabel:`Plan Name`: the specific name for the onboarding plan.
- :guilabel:`Model`: specifies where this plan can be used. In this case, in the **Employees** app.
- :guilabel:`Department`: if left blank (the default setting) this plan is available for all
  departments. Limit the use of the plan to a specific department by selecting the department using
  the drop-down menu.
- :guilabel:`Activities To Create`: this tab lists all the onboarding steps. Each row displays:

  - :guilabel:`Activity Type`: the specific activity for the step. The default options are
    :guilabel:`Email`, :guilabel:`Call`, :guilabel:`Meeting`, :guilabel:`To-Do`, or

  - :guilabel:`Assignment`: chooses who completes the activity, relative to the new hire:

    - :guilabel:`Ask at launch`: choose the user in the :guilabel:`Assigned To` field when
      :ref:`launching the onboarding plan <employees/launch-plan>`.
    - :guilabel:`Default user`: choose a user who always handles this activity. Defined in the
      :guilabel:`Assigned to` field.
    - :guilabel:`Manager`: assigns the employee's manager as defined on the employee record.
    - :guilabel:`Coach`:  assigns the employee's coach as defined on the employee record.
    - :guilabel:`Employee`: the new hire completes the activity.
    - :guilabel:`Fleet Manager`: assigns the designated **Fleet** app manager. This option is only
      available if the **Fleet** app is installed.

  - :guilabel:`Assigned to`: this field remains blank, unless :guilabel:`Default user` is selected
    for the :guilabel:`Assignment` field. If :guilabel:`Default user` is selected, this field is
    populated with the selected user.
  - :guilabel:`Document to sign`: the corresponding document requiring a signature.
  - :guilabel:`Interval`: the time when the activity is active.
  - :guilabel:`Unit`: the set time interval, either :guilabel:`days`, :guilabel:`weeks`, or
    :guilabel:`months`.
  - :guilabel:`Trigger`: how scheduling is determined for the activity. Options are either

    .. example::
       A laptop must be set up and registered to a new employee the day before they start work. The
       person who performs this step should always be the IT Manager, Abby Jones.

       To configure this activity with these parameters, the :guilabel:`Activity Type` is set to
       :guilabel:`To-Do`, with a summary of :guilabel:`Assign Laptop`. The :guilabel:`Assignment`
       field is set to :guilabel:`Default user`, and the :guilabel:`Assigned to` field is set to
       :guilabel:`Abby Jones`. The :guilabel:`Interval` is :guilabel:`1`, and the :guilabel:`Unit`
       is set to :guilabel:`days`. The :guilabel:`Trigger` is :guilabel:`Before Plan Date`.

.. _employees/modify-plan:

Modify onboarding plan
======================

A single onboarding plan works only if the flow works for the entire company.

.. note::
   If the onboarding plan is universal, add to or modify the default onboarding plan. If
   department-specific onboarding plans are needed, :ref:`create a new onboarding plan
   <employees/create-plan>`.

To modify the default plan, first navigate to :menuselection:`Employees app --> Configuration -->

.. _employees/create-plan:

Create onboarding plan
======================

Some companies require different onboarding plans, when there are department-specific onboarding
procedures that do not apply to the whole company. For these cases, a new department-specific
onboarding plan must be created.

To create a new onboarding plan, :ref:`navigate to the desired plan and configure all the desired
steps <employees/modify-plan>`.

.. example::
   A company specializing in the manufacturing and selling of outdoor metal furniture may have a
   large factory that produces the products, and a separate sales office. This company may have two
   separate onboarding plans, one for factory workers, and one for office workers.

   The onboarding plan for the factory workers is set for the :guilabel:`Manufacturing` department,
   and includes specialized tasks relating to factory jobs. These include gathering the new
   employees uniform and safety gear, assigning a safety course, emailing their team about the new
   hire, going over benefits, and more.

   .. image:: onboarding/factory-onboarding.png
      :alt: An onboarding plan configured for factory workers.

.. _employees/launch-plan:

Employee retention report
=========================

It is possible to determine the retention rate for a company by modifying an existing report.

First, navigate to :menuselection:`Employees app --> Reporting --> Contracts` to open the
:guilabel:`Employee Analysis` report. This report shows the number of all employees for the
:guilabel:`Last 365 Days`, in a default :icon:`fa-line-chart` :guilabel:`Line Chart`.

.. image:: retention_report/employees-analysis.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The default Employees Analysis report.

Next, click the :guilabel:`Measures` :icon:`fa-caret-down` button in the upper-left corner,
revealing a drop-down menu. Click :guilabel:`# Departure Employee` in the list, then click away from
the drop-down menu to close it. Now, the report shows all the employees who were archived for the
:guilabel:`Last 365 Days`.

To view this information in an easier format, click the :icon:`oi-view-pivot` :guilabel:`(Pivot)`
icon in the upper-right corner, and the data is presented in a pivot table.

The various employees, organized by department, populate the rows. The columns display the following
totals: the monthly :guilabel:`Wage`, the :guilabel:`Fuel Card` budget, total :guilabel:`Annual
Employee Budget` (also referred to as the *annual salary*), the number of :guilabel:`New Employees`,
as well as the number of :guilabel:`Departure Employees` (employees who left).

.. image:: retention_report/pivot-departures.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The Employees Analysis report, modified to show departed employees only.

Employee retention rate comparison report
=========================================

It is possible to compare data only for employees who left, compared to the total current employees,
between two separate time periods. This is commonly referred to as the *employee retention rate*.

To view these metrics, first open the :guilabel:`Employee Analysis` report by navigating to
:menuselection:`Employees app --> Reporting --> Contracts`. Click the :icon:`oi-view-pivot`
:guilabel:`(Pivot)` icon in the upper-right corner to view the information in a pivot table.

Next, click the :guilabel:`Measures` :icon:`fa-caret-down` button in the upper-left corner,
revealing a drop-down menu. Click :guilabel:`# New Employees`, :guilabel:`Annual Employee Budget`,
:guilabel:`Fuel Card`, and :guilabel:`Wage` in the list, to deselect these metrics and hide them in
the table. Then, click :guilabel:`Count` at the bottom of the list to enable that metric.

Click away from the drop-down menu to close it. Now, the report shows all the employees who left the
company (:guilabel:`# Departure Employee`), as well as the total number of employees
(:guilabel:`Count`), for the :guilabel:`Last 365 Days`.

To compare the data for the current year with the previous year, click the :icon:`fa-caret-down`
:guilabel:`(down arrow)` in the search bar, revealing multiple filter and grouping options. Click
:guilabel:`Last 365 Days` in the :icon:`fa-filter` :guilabel:`Filters` column, to turn off that
filter. Then, click :guilabel:`Date`, and click the current year (in this example, :guilabel:`2024`)
from the resulting drop-down menu.

Once a selection is made beneath :guilabel:`Date` in the :icon:`fa-filter` :guilabel:`Filters`
column, a :icon:`fa-adjust` :guilabel:`Comparison` column appears. Click :guilabel:`Date: Previous
Year` in the new column, then click off of the drop-down menu to close it.

.. note::
   In Odoo, in order to access the :icon:`fa-adjust` :guilabel:`Comparison` column, a specific time
   *other than* :guilabel:`Last 365 Days` **must** be selected. If not, the :icon:`fa-adjust`
   :guilabel:`Comparison` column is **not** visible.

Now, the pivot table displays the total number of employees who left the company (:guilabel:`#
Departure Employee`), as well as the total number of employees (:guilabel:`Count`) in the columns.
These are further divided by the two different years, and also displays the :guilabel:`Variation`
between the two.

The rows display the departments, and lists each individual employee for each department, in the
rows.

For a more concise view of this report, click :icon:`fa-minus-square-o` :guilabel:`Total` above the
top row of the departments and employees, to collapse the rows. Now, the table presents the total
number of employees who left the company for both years, compared to the total number of employees
for both years, including the difference, in a percentage.

.. example::
   In this example, :guilabel:`3` employees out of :guilabel:`83` left in 2023, and :guilabel:`8`
   employees out of :guilabel:`202` left in 2024. There was a :guilabel:`166.67%` increase in the
   employees who left in 2024 as compared to 2023. Additionally, there was a :guilabel:`143.37%`
   increase in the total number of employees in 2024 as compared to 2023.

   .. image:: retention_report/comparison-years.png
      :align: center
      :alt: The report modified to show the difference between two years of employees who left.

To view more detailed rates for each department, click :icon:`fa-plus-square` :guilabel:`Total` in
the single row, revealing a drop-down menu, and click :guilabel:`Department`. Click away from the
drop-down to close it, and now the pivot table displays the total number of employees who left
(:guilabel:`# Departure Employee`), the total number of employees (:guilabel:`Count`), and the
:guilabel:`Variation` (in a percentage) for both 2023 and 2024, organized by department.

.. example::
   In this example, it can be determined that the :guilabel:`Management` department had the best
   retention rate in 2024 as compared to 2023, with a :guilabel:`Variation` rate of
   :guilabel:`-100%`. Additionally, it can be determined that the :guilabel:`Management / Research &
   Development` department had the most turnover, with a :guilabel:`Variation` of :guilabel:`300%`.

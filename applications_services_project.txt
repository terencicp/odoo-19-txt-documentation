Project dashboard
=================

The project dashboard allows you to get a comprehensive overview of your project's status. It
displays information such as the total number of tasks, timesheets, and planned hours linked to the
project, as well as detailed information about project milestones and its costs and revenues. Within
the project dashboard, you can create :guilabel:`Project updates`, which allow you to take a
snapshot of the project's status at a certain point in time. As such, it is a crucial tool for
effective project management and ensuring that your project stays on track.

Using the project dashboard
===========================

To access the project dashboard, open the **Project** app and navigate to the applicable project.
Click the :icon:`fa-sliders` (:guilabel:`sliders`) icon to add :guilabel:`Dashboard` to the
project's :ref:`top bar <project/project-management/top-bar>`.

.. tip::
   You can also access the project dashboard by hovering over the desired project’s card, clicking
   the :icon:`fa-ellipsis-v` (:guilabel:`vertical ellipsis`), and selecting :guilabel:`Dashboard`.

The left side of the dashboard displays a list of existing :ref:`project updates <project/project-dashboard/updates>`,
and the right side provides :ref:`detailed information about records linked to the project
<project/project-dashboard/smart-buttons>`, as well as :ref:`milestones <project/project-dashboard/milestones>`,
:ref:`profitability <project/project-dashboard/profitability>`, and :ref:`budgets
<project/project-dashboard/budgets>`.

.. note::
   The information displayed on the project dashboard varies depending on the applications installed
   on your database. For example, you will not see information about **Timesheets**, **Planning**,
   or **Purchase Orders** if the corresponding applications are not installed.

.. _project/project-dashboard/smart-buttons:

Totals smart buttons
--------------------

The following smart buttons are displayed on the top right of the project dashboard:

 - :guilabel:`Tasks`: the number of completed (i.e., :guilabel:`Done` or :guilabel:`Canceled`
   :ref:`tasks <project/tasks/task_stages_statuses/statuses>`) and all tasks, in format
   completed/all, as well as the entire project's completion percentage estimation.
 - :guilabel:`Timesheets`: the number of hours or days (depending on the **Timesheets** app
   configuration) allocated in the project’s **settings**. This includes all
   :doc:`timesheets </applications/services/timesheets>`, whether or not they have been validated.
 - :guilabel:`Planned`: the number of hours that have been planned for shifts in the **Planning**
   app. This includes all :doc:`planned shifts </applications/services/planning>`, including past
   shifts and shifts that have not yet been published.
 - :guilabel:`Documents`: number of :doc:`documents </applications/productivity/documents>` in the
   project’s workspace.
 - :guilabel:`Burndown Chart`: click the smart button to access a :doc:`report </applications/essentials/reporting>`
   on the status of the project’s tasks over time.
 - :guilabel:`Timesheets and Planning`: click the smart button to access a :doc:`report </applications/essentials/reporting>`
   on the project’s timesheets and shifts. This allows you to easily compare planned and effective
   hours of work on the project.
 - **Additional fields**, such as :guilabel:`Sales Orders`, :guilabel:`Sales Order Items`,
   :guilabel:`Purchase Orders`, and more, represent the number of records linked to the project.

.. tip::
   Use the project dashboard smart buttons to update the project records easily. Click
   :guilabel:`Timesheets` to validate timesheets, :guilabel:`Planned` to create project planning,
   :guilabel:`Documents` to view and validate documents, etc.

.. _project/project-dashboard/milestones:

Milestones
----------

This section is only visible if :doc:`milestones <../project_management/project_milestones>` have
been enabled in the project you're browsing: go to :guilabel:`Project`, click the
:icon:`fa-ellipsis-v` (:guilabel:`vertical ellipsis`) icon on one of your projects, and click on
:guilabel:`Settings`. Click on the :guilabel:`Settings` tab, look for :guilabel:`Tasks Management`
and make sure :guilabel:`Milestones` is enabled.

In a project's Dashboard, click :guilabel:`Add Milestone` to create a new milestone. Click a
milestone in the checklist to edit it, enable its checkbox to mark it as completed, or click the
:icon:`fa-trash` (:guilabel:`trash`) icon to remove it.

The milestones are displayed in red if they’re past their deadline, or in green if they are ready to
be marked as reached (i.e. tasks linked to the milestone that have been marked with :guilabel:`done`
or :guilabel:`canceled` :ref:`status <project/tasks/task_stages_statuses/statuses>`).

.. _project/project-dashboard/profitability:

Profitability
-------------

The :doc:`profitability dashboard </applications/services/project/project_management/project_profitability>`
provides a breakdown of project costs and revenues, which are impacted by all records linked to the
project and its :doc:`Analytic account </applications/finance/accounting/reporting/analytic_accounting>`.

.. note::
   The profitability report is only displayed for billable projects.

.. _project/project-dashboard/budgets:

Budgets
-------

If a budget has been set for the project, its status and related details are displayed in this
section. Click :guilabel:`Add Budget` to create a new budget for the project.

.. note::
   :doc:`Budgets </applications/finance/accounting/reporting/budget>` must be enabled in your
   database’s **Accounting** application in order for this section to be displayed.

.. _project/project-dashboard/updates:

Project updates
===============

Project updates allow you to take a snapshot of the project’s overall status at a given point in
time, for example, during a periodic (weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly) review. This allows you to
compare specific data points, note any aspects of the project that need improvement, and estimate
if the project is on or off track.

To create a new project update, go to the project dashboard, click :guilabel:`New`, and fill in the
following fields:

  - :guilabel:`Status`: Choose between :guilabel:`On Track`, :guilabel:`At Risk`, :guilabel:`Off
    Track`, :guilabel:`On Hold`, and :guilabel:`Done`. Once the status is set, a color-coded dot is
    displayed on the project’s Kanban card, allowing the project manager to easily identify which
    projects need attention.
  - :guilabel:`Progress`: Manually input the completion percentage based on the project's progress.
  - :guilabel:`Date` and :guilabel:`Author`: These fields are automatically filled in with
    appropriate information based on the user who created the update and the current date.
  - :guilabel:`Description`: Use this rich-text field to gather notes. Depending on the project
    configuration (e.g., if the project is billable), this field may be pre-filled with current
    information on aspects such as profitability, budget, milestones, etc.


==================================================

==================
Project management
==================

Odoo Project uses the **Kanban** project management system. This means all projects are broken down
into tasks, which are categorized on a whiteboard according to what production phase they are in.

.. admonition:: Did you know?

   The word **Kanban** comes from Japanese and refers to the "visual board" management method.

.. _project_management/configuration:

Configuration
=============

Open the **Project** app and click :guilabel:`Create` to start a new project. Enter a
:guilabel:`Name` for your project and click :guilabel:`Create Project`.

You can customize your existing **projects** from the dashboard by clicking the drop-down toggle
button (:guilabel:`⋮`) on your project's **card**.

.. image:: project_management/project-settings.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Project card

This enables a new menu divided into four parts:

- :guilabel:`View`: see an overview of your project's components, such as its :guilabel:`Tasks`,
  :guilabel:`Milestones` and :guilabel:`Project Updates`. Depending on which apps you have
  activated, more options may be available, such as :guilabel:`Documents`. All uploaded files can be
  found under this menu, as well as in the **Documents** app, under :guilabel:`Projects`;
- :guilabel:`Reporting`: analyze your project's progress and profitability through graphics and
  statistics;
- **Color**: make a line of color appear on the left side of the card so that your project is more
  recognizable;
- :guilabel:`Settings`: you can change the following:

  - the :guilabel:`Name` of the project;
  - the :guilabel:`Name of the tasks` found under that project;
  - the :guilabel:`Customer` for whom the project is intended;
  - the :guilabel:`Tags` used for filtering;
  - the :guilabel:`Company` responsible for the project;
  - the employee designated as :guilabel:`Project Manager`;
  - the :guilabel:`Planned Date` of the project;
  - the total :guilabel:`Allocated Hours` for that project.

Additionally, you can mark the project as :guilabel:`Favorite`, allowing you to find it using the
:guilabel:`My Favorites` filter on the Kanban view;

   :alt: Project settings

.. seealso::
   `Odoo Tutorials: Customize projects
   <https://www.odoo.com/slides/slide/customize-projects-3615?fullscreen=1>`_

Further settings are available under the :guilabel:`Settings` tab. Most of them are *only* available
depending on the activated apps.

Visibility and collaboration
----------------------------

Odoo allows you to set visibility settings for each project, enabling you to make your project
available to everyone in your organization or restrict access to certain internal or external users.

To do so, go to the project's :guilabel:`Settings` tab and choose the desired :guilabel:`Visibility`
option:

- :guilabel:`Invited internal users (private)`: Only users following the project and users with the
  Project Administrator :doc:`access right </applications/general/users/access_rights>` can
  access the project and its tasks.
- :guilabel:`All internal users`: All internal users can access the project and all of its tasks.
- :guilabel:`Invited portal users and all internal users (public)`: All internal users can access
  the project and all of its tasks. When following a project, :doc:`portal users
  </applications/general/users/user_portals>` only have access to the specific tasks they are following.
  This option is selected by default.

Inviting external users
-----------------------

To invite external users, make sure that :guilabel:`Invited portal users and all internal users
(public)` is selected, then click :guilabel:`Share Project` at the top of the project’s settings.
The following options are available:

- Copy and share the :guilabel:`Public Link` displayed at the top of the pop-up window. Anyone with
  this link can access the project in read mode.
- Or click :guilabel:`Add a line`, select a :guilabel:`Collaborator`, choose the
  :guilabel:`Access Mode`, and check the box to send an invitation to their email address.

  There are three types of :guilabel:`Access Mode` for collaborators:

  - :guilabel:`Read`: Collaborators can view tasks but cannot edit them.
  - :guilabel:`Edit with limited access`: Collaborators can view and edit the tasks they follow.
  - :guilabel:`Edit`: Collaborators can view and edit all tasks.

To revoke an invited collaborator's access, click :guilabel:`Share Project` at the top of the
project’s settings, then click the :icon:`fa-trash-o` :guilabel:`(trash)` icon.

.. note::
   Internal users without access to the project can still access a task if the URL has been shared
   with them. For projects set as :guilabel:`Invited internal users (private)`, they must also
   be a follower of the task.

Scheduling activities
=====================

You can schedule **activities** (ex. :guilabel:`Call`, :guilabel:`Meeting`, etc.) per project by
clicking on the **clock** icon on a project. Doing so opens a list with already scheduled activities
and allows planning **new** activities by clicking :guilabel:`+ Schedule an activity`. On the pop-up
window, select the :guilabel:`Activity Type`, enter a :guilabel:`Summary` for that activity, a
:guilabel:`Due Date`, and assign it to an employee. According to the :guilabel:`Activity Type`, you
may have **additional options** available.

.. note::
   If an activity is **already** scheduled, the icon may change to a **phone**, **group of people**,
   or other.

.. _project/project-management/top-bar:

Top bar
=======

In project management, reviewing the various records and documents related to a project is often
necessary. Odoo Project’s **top bar** provides quick access to these essential resources. You can
customize each project's top bar to match its specific needs.

To set up the top bar for a project, go to the :guilabel:`Project` app, click the project's card,
then click the top bar :icon:`fa-sliders` :guilabel:`(sliders)` button. In the bar that appears
above the search bar, click the :icon:`fa-sliders` :guilabel:`(sliders)` button to select the records
you want to display, such as timesheets, sales orders, invoices, documents, dashboards, etc.

You can then click the buttons to access the related records without leaving the Project app. To
return to your project tasks' Kanban view, click the :guilabel:`Tasks` button in the top bar.

.. image:: project_management/top-bar.png
   :alt: Top bar selection menu

Custom top bar buttons
----------------------

You can also create your own buttons to access more specific views:

#. Click an existing top bar button to access the view.
#. Customize the view with keywords, filters, and grouping options using the search bar.
#. Click the :icon:`fa-sliders` :guilabel:`(sliders)` button in the top bar and select
   :guilabel:`Save View`.
#. Edit the default button name if necessary, then enable :guilabel:`Shared` if you want to share
   the button with other users.

==================================================

==================
Project milestones
==================

**Milestones** enable you to track ongoing project work by designating a sequence of key steps that
must be reached before the project’s completion. Milestones are particularly useful in expensive,
long, or large-scale projects. They can be used purely for indicative purposes, as a way to ensure
that the project is completed in a timely manner.

Milestones can also be used as a basis for :doc:`invoicing the client </applications/sales/sales/invoicing/milestone>`.
This benefits both parties, as it ensures consistent cash flow for project funding and allows the
client to pay for the project in several installments.

Configuration
=============

Enable milestones for the desired project by opening the :guilabel:`Project` app, clicking the
:icon:`fa-ellipsis-v` (:guilabel:`vertical ellipsis`) on the project’s card, and clicking
:guilabel:`Settings`. Under :guilabel:`Tasks Management`, enable :guilabel:`Milestones`.

.. note::
   Milestones are automatically enabled for projects created from a sales order for a service
   :doc:`invoiced by milestone </applications/sales/sales/invoicing/milestone>`.

Configure project milestones by clicking the :icon:`fa-ellipsis-v` (:guilabel:`vertical ellipsis`)
on the project’s card and selecting :guilabel:`Milestones`. Create a milestone by clicking
:guilabel:`New`, entering the milestone's :guilabel:`Name`, selecting a :guilabel:`Deadline` if
desired, and clicking :guilabel:`Save`.

Add or remove options by clicking the :icon:`oi-settings-adjust` :guilabel:`sliders`. The following
options are relevant when using
:doc:`invoicing based on milestones </applications/sales/sales/invoicing/milestone>`:

 - :guilabel:`Sales Order Item`: this field is filled in automatically with the Sales Order number.
 - :guilabel:`Quantity (%)`: percentage of the ordered quantity that will automatically be delivered
   on the sales order once the milestone is marked as reached.

Once milestones are configured, **you can link project tasks to milestones**. To do so, navigate to
the project you created the milestones in, then click one of the tasks to open it. Then, click the
:guilabel:`Milestone` field to open a drop-down menu. Select the desired milestone from the list.

Once all the tasks linked to the milestone are completed (marked as
:doc:`Done or Cancelled <../tasks/task_stages_statuses>`), the milestone will be automatically
marked as :guilabel:`Reached` in the :menuselection:`Project --> Settings --> Milestones`. You can
also check the :guilabel:`Reached` box manually whenever the milestone is reached. Manual checking
of the box will not impact the tasks linked to the milestone.

.. _project/using-milestones:

Using milestones
================

Odoo offers several ways to oversee the project’s milestones and their relationship to ongoing
tasks.

In the **Gantt view**, a milestone is shown as a vertical line marked with a diamond shape,
displayed on the day of the milestone’s deadline. The line is color-coded in blue to indicate that
the milestone has not yet reached its deadline, or it has been marked as reached (in which case, a
check mark is displayed on the milestone). A milestone is color-coded in red if it has not been
reached by its deadline.

If a milestone’s deadline falls on the same day as the project’s deadline, it is displayed with a
vertical line marked with a circle, and the same color coding principles as above apply.

Aside from the Gantt view, you can also create, edit, and mark milestones as reached from
:ref:`the project dashboard <project/project-dashboard/milestones>`.

.. image:: project_milestones/gantt-milestones.png

==================================================
SECTION: project_profitability.rst
PATH: applications/services/project/project_management/project_profitability.rst
==================================================

=====================
Project profitability
=====================

When handling billable projects, it is essential to determine whether your projects are turning a
profit. Measuring **project profitability** involves keeping track of the costs of resources used to
carry out the project, such as employee costs, materials used, purchases, expenses, or after-sales
services, and comparing them with the project revenues.

Project profitability is tracked in the :doc:`project dashboard <project_dashboard>` on all billable
projects.

To access the :doc:`project dashboard <project_dashboard>`, open the **Project** app and navigate to
the applicable project. Click the :icon:`fa-sliders` (:guilabel:`sliders`) icon to add
:guilabel:`Dashboard` to the project's :ref:`top bar <project/project-management/top-bar>`.

.. tip::
   You can also access the :doc:`project dashboard <project_dashboard>` by hovering over the desired
   project’s card, clicking the :icon:`fa-ellipsis-v` (:guilabel:`vertical ellipsis`), and selecting
   :guilabel:`Dashboard`.

The **profitability dashboard** is on the right side of the project dashboard and displays data for
all records linked to the project and its
:doc:`analytic account </applications/finance/accounting/reporting/analytic_accounting>`. It’s
divided into two major sections: :ref:`revenues <project/project-profitability/revenues>`, which
displays a breakdown of income generated by the project, and
:ref:`costs <project/project-profitability/costs>` accrued by your company. The same record can be
displayed in both sections, e.g., the same timesheet is listed under :guilabel:`Revenues` with the
amount the customer paid for the work and under :guilabel:`Costs` with the amount of wages paid to
the employees.

.. image:: project_profitability/profitability-dashboard.png
   :alt: Project dashboard.

The amounts displayed in the profitability report are divided into three columns:

 - :guilabel:`Expected`: the amounts expected based on existing sales or purchase orders.
 - :guilabel:`To invoice` (revenues) or :guilabel:`To bill` (costs): the amounts are moved to this
   column when the work or goods have been delivered, e.g., a
   :doc:`timesheet </applications/services/timesheets>` has been created and/or validated, a
   delivery order has been marked as done, or the delivered quantity has been manually updated on
   the sales order.
 - :guilabel:`Invoiced` or :guilabel:`Billed`: the amounts are moved to this column once an invoice
   or bill has been confirmed.

Based on the same principle, the revenues section is further divided into :guilabel:`Sold`,
:guilabel:`Delivered`, and :guilabel:`Invoiced` columns. Use the :icon:`fa-caret-right`
(:guilabel:`arrow`) icon to see a detailed breakdown for each line.

.. tip::
   Use the project’s :ref:`top bar <project/project-management/top-bar>` to easily access and edit
   records linked to the project’s profitability from the project’s Kanban view.

.. important::
   In order for a record to be displayed on the profitability dashboard, it must be linked to the
   project and its :doc:`analytic account </applications/finance/accounting/reporting/analytic_accounting>`.

The following records can be displayed in the profitability dashboard.

.. _project/project-profitability/revenues:

Revenues
--------

 - :guilabel:`Timesheets`: revenues from :doc:`timesheets </applications/services/timesheets>`,
   broken down according to the :guilabel:`Invoicing Policy` selected on the product form (e.g.,
   :doc:`Prepaid/Fixed Price </applications/sales/sales/invoicing/invoicing_policy>`,
   :doc:`Based on Timesheets </applications/sales/sales/invoicing/time_materials>`,
   :doc:`Based on Milestones </applications/sales/sales/invoicing/milestone>`).
 - :guilabel:`Materials`: total of sales prices of products sold via sales orders linked to the
   project.
 - :guilabel:`Customer invoices`: a total of invoices linked to the project.
 - :guilabel:`Subscriptions`: a total of sales prices of
   :doc:`subscriptions </applications/sales/subscriptions>` linked to the project.
 - :guilabel:`Down payments`: a total of
   :doc:`down payments </applications/sales/sales/invoicing/down_payment>` linked to the project.
 - :guilabel:`Expenses`: any :doc:`expenses </applications/finance/expenses>` that have been
   :doc:`reinvoiced to the customer </applications/sales/sales/invoicing/expense>`.

.. _project/project-profitability/costs:

Costs
-----

 - :guilabel:`Timesheets`: total cost of time tracked by employees via :doc:`timesheets
   </applications/services/timesheets>`, based on the employee's
   :ref:`HR settings <employees/hr-settings>`.
 - :guilabel:`Purchase Orders`: total cost of
   :doc:`purchase orders </applications/inventory_and_mrp/purchase/manage_deals>` linked to the
   project. Those could cover goods, materials, or even subcontracted services. This entry only
   appears once the vendor bill is posted.
 - :guilabel:`Materials`: total cost of products included in
   :doc:`stock moves </applications/inventory_and_mrp/inventory/shipping_receiving>` (deliveries and
   receipts) that have been validated for the project. This section is only displayed if
   :guilabel:`Analytic Costs` have been enabled in
   :menuselection:`Inventory --> Configuration --> Operations Types` for applicable operations. This
   ensures that the product's cost is tracked during the stock move.
 - :guilabel:`Expenses`: total costs of :doc:`expenses </applications/finance/expenses>` linked to
   the project that have been submitted and approved.
 - :guilabel:`Vendor bills`: total costs of
   :doc:`vendor bills </applications/inventory_and_mrp/purchase/manage_deals/manage>` linked to the
   project's analytic account.
 - :guilabel:`Manufacturing orders`: total costs of manufacturing orders linked to the project's
   analytic account.
 - :guilabel:`Other costs`: any other costs linked to the project's analytic account.


==================================================
SECTION: project_templates.rst
PATH: applications/services/project/project_management/project_templates.rst
==================================================

=================
Project templates
=================

Templates allow you to create new projects with predefined settings, reducing the need to manually
set up similar projects repeatedly.

Creating templates
==================

To create a project template, an existing project is required and used as a base to be converted
into a template. Converting a project into a template transfers the entire project's properties to
the template. This includes the project’s stages, tasks, sub-tasks, and their respective
configurations, such as planned dates, statuses, assignees, and more.

First, access the settings of the project that you want to convert into a template by going to
:guilabel:`Projects`, hovering your mouse over the project's card, clicking the :icon:`fa-ellipsis-v`
(:guilabel:`vertical ellipsis`) icon, and selecting :guilabel:`Settings`. Review
and adjust the project’s properties to ensure it reflects your desired template setup.

Once your project is ready, click the :icon:`fa-cog` (:guilabel:`cog`) icon and select
:guilabel:`Convert to Template`. The :guilabel:`Template` banner indicates that the project has been
successfully converted into a template.

.. warning::
   Converting a project into a template will also archive the original project used to create the
   template. To keep using a project that you want to convert into a template, duplicate
   it first by hovering your mouse over the project's card, clicking the
   :icon:`fa-ellipsis-v` (:guilabel:`vertical ellipsis`) icon, and selecting :guilabel:`Duplicate`.

.. tip::
   To edit or delete a template, go to :menuselection:`Projects --> New`.
   Next to the name of the template, click the :icon:`fa-pencil` (:guilabel:`pencil`) icon to edit
   it or the :icon:`fa-trash` (:guilabel:`trash`) icon to delete it.
   Editing or deleting a template does not affect the projects that were previously created from it.

Project roles in templates
--------------------------

Templates enable you to pre-select specific roles for tasks within your template, making the
selection of assignees faster during the creation of a new project using a template.

Go to :menuselection:`Projects --> New`, and click the :icon:`fa-pencil` (:guilabel:`pencil`)
icon next to the name of the template you want to edit. Then click on the :guilabel:`Tasks` smart
button, and on one of the tasks. In the :guilabel:`Project Roles` field, type or select the roles
that you want to perform this task, then click :guilabel:`Save`.

Create a project based on this template: go to :menuselection:`Projects --> New`, and click on
the name of the template. The :guilabel:`Create a project from template` form then includes
:guilabel:`Project Roles`. For each of them, you can select assignees by clicking on the
:guilabel:`Assignees` field. This automatically dispatches the right tasks to the right employees.

Task scheduling in templates
----------------------------

In a project template, task scheduling can be automated according to the planned dates specified
within the template.

.. important::
   Project and task planned dates are not saved when converting a project into a template. These
   require to be added to the template after it is created.

On the project template, define the :guilabel:`Planned dates` for both the project and each task.
When tasks have planned start dates in the template, Odoo calculates the number of days
between the project’s start date and the first scheduled task. This time window is referred to as
the *delta*.

When a new project is generated from this template:

 - The system uses the project’s start date as a reference.
 - Each task’s start date is automatically planned according to its delta.
 - If no start date is set on the new project, the current date is used as the default start date.
 - Task end dates are then determined automatically by Odoo’s scheduling algorithm.

.. note::
   To ensure that all project roles and tasks are planned without conflict according to the team’s
   availability and workload, the scheduling algorithm calculates the end date of each task based on
   the allocated time, while also considering task dependencies and assignee’s availability, working
   schedule, time off, and public holidays.

Using templates
===============

To create a new project from a template, go to :menuselection:`Projects --> New`, and click on a
template in the :guilabel:`Project Templates` section. Enter a name for your project. Optionally,
add a :guilabel:`Customer`, a :guilabel:`Planned Date`, and set up the task creation email. Then,
click :guilabel:`Create Project`.

Templates can also be linked to specific products. To do so, the project template must be set as
:guilabel:`Billable`:

- Go to :menuselection:`Projects --> New` and click the :icon:`fa-pencil` (:guilabel:`pencil`) icon
  next to the name of the template you want to edit.
- Click the :guilabel:`Settings` tab, tick the :guilabel:`Billable` checkbox, and click
  :guilabel:`Save`.

Once this is done, configure the product by:

- Selecting :guilabel:`Service` as the :guilabel:`Product Type`.
- Selecting :guilabel:`Project` or :guilabel:`Project & Task` in the :guilabel:`Create on Order` field.
- Selecting a :guilabel:`Project Template` and clicking :guilabel:`Save`.


==================================================
SECTION: recurring_tasks.rst
PATH: applications/services/project/tasks/recurring_tasks.rst
==================================================

===============
Recurring tasks
===============

When handling a project, the same task often needs to be performed several times: for example,
weekly meetings or status reports. The **recurring tasks** feature allows you to automate the
creation of those tasks.

.. seealso::
   `Odoo Tutorials: Recurring tasks <https://www.odoo.com/slides/slide/recurring-tasks-6958>`_

Configuration
=============

To use task dependencies in a project, go to :guilabel:`Project`, click the :icon:`fa-ellipsis-v`
(:guilabel:`vertical ellipsis`) icon on one of your projects, and click on :guilabel:`Settings`.
Click on the :guilabel:`Settings` tab, look for :guilabel:`Tasks Management` and make sure
:guilabel:`Recurring Tasks` is enabled.

Set up task recurrence

In an existing task, click the :icon:`fa-repeat` (:guilabel:`Recurrent`) button next to the
:guilabel:`Deadline` field. Then, configure the :guilabel:`Repeat Every` field according to your
needs.

A new task in recurrence will be created once the status of the previous task is set to
:guilabel:`Done` or :guilabel:`Canceled`.

The new task is created on the project dashboard with the following configuration:

- :guilabel:`Stage`: is set to the first stage of the project dashboard (:guilabel:`New` or
  equivalent);
- :guilabel:`Name`, :guilabel:`Description`, :guilabel:`Project`, :guilabel:`Assignees`,
  :guilabel:`Customer`, :guilabel:`Tags`: are copied from the original task;
- :guilabel:`Deadline`: is updated based on the :guilabel:`Repeat Every` field (e.g., if the task is
  set to repeat once a week, 7 days will be added to the deadline);
- :guilabel:`Milestones`, :guilabel:`Timesheets`, :guilabel:`Chatter`,
  :guilabel:`Activities`, :guilabel:`Subtasks`: are **not** copied from the original task.

Once a recurrence is configured, a **smart button** on the task displays the total number of
existing recurrences.

Edit or stop task recurrence
----------------------------

**To edit** the recurrence, open the last task in recurrence. Any changes made on the task will be
applied to the tasks that will be created in the future.

**To stop** the recurrence, open the last task in recurrence and press the :guilabel:`Recurrent`
button next to the :guilabel:`Planned date`.

Sub-tasks
=========

When handling project tasks, you can often benefit from splitting the workload into smaller
**sub-tasks**, making it easier to track progress and manage the work.

Odoo’s sub-task feature is particularly useful in some of the following cases:

- The task workload is too big to handle in one record.
- There’s a clear sequence of steps to follow.
- Some parts of the workload fall under the scope of different projects and/or assignees.

The original task to which sub-tasks are linked is referred to as the **parent task**. The sub-tasks
of the parent task are known as **child tasks**.

Creating sub-tasks
==================

To create a sub-task:

#. Open the Project app, then go into your desired project.
#. Click the task where you want to add the sub-task, then click the :guilabel:`Sub-tasks` tab.
#. Click :guilabel:`Add a line`, then fill in the :guilabel:`Title`.
#. Click the :icon:`fa-cloud-upload` (:guilabel:`save`) icon to save the task manually.

.. tip::
   You can edit several fields of a sub-task directly from the parent task’s sub-task tab without
   opening the individual sub-task. By default, those are: :guilabel:`Title`, :guilabel:`Priority`,
   :guilabel:`Status`, and :guilabel:`Assignees`. Use the :icon:`fa-sliders` (:guilabel:`sliders`)
   icon to add or remove fields.

Once the new sub-task is created, the following changes occur in the parent task:

- A **smart button** displays the total number of sub-tasks, as well as the number of closed
  (**done** or **canceled**) sub-tasks. Click the smart button to access the list of the sub-tasks.
- The :guilabel:`Allocated time` displays the amount of time allocated to the parent task, as well
  as time allocated to the sub-tasks. This can be used to ensure that the time allocated to
  sub-tasks does not exceed time allocated to the parent task.
- The :guilabel:`Timesheets` tab includes a breakdown of time spent on the parent task as well as
  sub-tasks.

Click :guilabel:`View` to open the sub-task you created. The sub-task form is identical to the
:ref:`task form <task_creation/task-configuration>`.

.. tip::

 - A **smart button** allows to navigate back to the :guilabel:`Parent task`.
 - The :guilabel:`Sub-tasks` tab allows for further creation of sub-tasks.
 - Selecting a :guilabel:`Project` will trigger this sub-task to be displayed in the Kanban view of
   the selected project.

Task creation
=============

Tasks in Odoo Project can be created manually or automatically, including from emails or website
forms.

Manual task creation
====================

Open the Project app and choose the desired project. Create a new task by doing one of the
following:

 - Clicking the :icon:`fa-plus` (:guilabel:`plus`) button in the upper left corner. This creates
   a new task in the first stage of your Kanban view.
 - Pressing the :icon:`fa-plus` (:guilabel:`plus`) button next to the Kanban stage name. This
   creates a new task in this Kanban stage.

Fill in the :guilabel:`Task Title` and add one or more :guilabel:`Assignees`, then click
:guilabel:`Add`.

.. _task_creation/task-configuration:

Task configuration
------------------

Click the task to open it. The task form includes the following fields that you can fill in:

 - :guilabel:`Task Title`: title of the task.
 - :icon:`fa-star-o` (:guilabel:`Star`): click the :icon:`fa-star-o` (:guilabel:`star`) icon to mark
   the task as high priority. The icon will turn yellow. Click it again to remove the high priority.
 - :guilabel:`Project`: the project that this task belongs to.
 - :guilabel:`Assignees`: the person(s) in charge of handling the work on this task.
 - :guilabel:`Tags`: custom labels allowing to categorize and filter your tasks.
 - :guilabel:`Customer`: the person or company that will be billed for this task. This field only
   appears in tasks that belong to billable projects.
 - :guilabel:`Sales Order Item`: this can be either the sales order that was used to create this
   task, or a sales order that was linked to this task manually. This field only appears in tasks
   linked to billable projects.
 - :guilabel:`Allocated Time`: the amount of time that the work on this task is expected to last,
   tracked by timesheets.
 - :guilabel:`Deadline`: the expected end date of the task. Click the :guilabel:`Deadline` field to
   select the task's end date in the dropdown calendar. To define the task's duration, including its
   start and end dates (and optionally specific times), click the :icon:`fa-calendar-plus-o`
   (:guilabel:`fa-calendar-plus-o`) icon in the dropdown calendar, select the dates and times, then
   click  :guilabel:`Apply` to save.

.. tip::

   - You can also create new tasks by switching to the list or Gantt view and clicking
     :guilabel:`New`.
   - The following fields can also be edited directly from the Kanban view without opening the
     individual task: :icon:`fa-star-o` (**priority**), :guilabel:`Allocated hours`,
     :guilabel:`Assignees`, and **task status**. You can also **color code** or :guilabel:`Set a
     Cover image` to your task by clicking the :icon:`fa-ellipsis-v` (**vertical ellipsis**).
   - You can use the following keyboard shortcuts in the task title to configure new tasks (modify
     the values in the examples below according to your needs):

     - **30h**: to allocate 30 hours to the task.
     - **#tags**: to add tags to the task.
     - **@user**: to assign the task to a user.
     - **!**: to star the task as high priority.

     Along with using the correct format, follow this order: the task's name, followed by the
     allocated time, the tags, the assignee, and then the priority.

     For example, if you want to create a task named "Prepare workshop", allocate 5h hours to it,
     add the "School" tag, assign it to Audrey and set its priority to :guilabel:`High`, enter the
     following task title: Prepare workshop 5h #school @Audrey !

.. _task_creation/email_alias:

Creating tasks from an email alias
==================================

This feature allows for project tasks to be automatically created once an email is delivered to a
designated email address.

To configure it, open the Project app, then click the :icon:`fa-ellipsis-v` (:guilabel:`vertical
ellipsis`) icon next to the desired project's name. Select :guilabel:`Settings`, then open the
:guilabel:`Settings` tab.

Fill in the :guilabel:`Create tasks by sending an email to` field as follows:

 - **Section of the alias before the @ symbol**: type the name of the email alias, e.g. `contact`,
   `help`, `jobs`.
 - **Domain**: in most cases, this is filled in by default with your :doc:`domain
   <../../../general/email_communication>`.
 - **Accept Emails From**: refine the senders whose emails will create tasks in the project.

.. image:: task_creation/email-configuration.png
   :alt: View of the email alias chosen on the dashboard view in Odoo Project

Once configured, the email alias can be seen under the name of your project on the Kanban dashboard.

When an email is sent to the alias, the email is automatically converted into a project task. The
following rules apply:

- The email sender is displayed in the :guilabel:`Customer` field.
- The email subject is displayed in the :guilabel:`Task Title` field.
- The email body is displayed in the :guilabel:`Description` field.
- The whole content of the email is additionally displayed in the **chatter**.
- All the recipients of the email (To/Cc/Bcc) that are Odoo users are automatically added as
  **followers** of the task.

Creating tasks from a website form
==================================

If you have the Website app installed in your database, you can configure any form on your
website to trigger the creation of tasks in a project.

#. Go to the website page where you wish to add the form and :doc:`add the Form building block
   </applications/websites/website/web_design/building_blocks>`.
#. In the website editor, edit the following fields:

   - :guilabel:`Action`: select :guilabel:`Create a Task`.
   - :guilabel:`Project`: choose the project that you want the new tasks to be created in.

#. :ref:`Customize the form <website/building_blocks/form>`.

When the form is submitted, it automatically creates a project task. The task's content is defined
by the form's corresponding fields.

SECTION: task_dependencies.rst
PATH: applications/services/project/tasks/task_dependencies.rst
==================================================

=================
Task dependencies
=================

Odoo Project allows you to break down projects into tasks and establish relationships between those
tasks to determine the order in which they are executed. Task dependencies ensure that certain tasks
begin only after the preceding tasks are completed.

To use task dependencies in a project, go to :guilabel:`Project`, click the :icon:`fa-ellipsis-v`
(:guilabel:`vertical ellipsis`) icon on one of your projects, and click on :guilabel:`Settings`.
Click on the :guilabel:`Settings`. Click on the :guilabel:`Settings` tab, look for :guilabel:`Tasks
Management` and make sure :guilabel:`Task Dependencies` is enabled.

Set task dependencies
=====================

Task dependencies can be created from the task form or the project's Gantt view by linking the
successor task (i.e., the task blocked by other tasks) to its predecessor task(s) (i.e., the tasks
blocking the successor task).

To create task dependencies from the task form, access the desired task and, in the
:guilabel:`Blocked by` tab, click :guilabel:`Add a line`. Click :guilabel:`View` to access the
predecessor task. To access the successor tasks from the predecessor task, click the
:guilabel:`Blocked Tasks` smart button.

To create a task dependency from the Gantt view, hover your mouse over the predecessor task, then
click one of the dots that appear around it. Drag and drop the dot onto the successor task. An arrow
appears, indicating the dependency from the predecessor task to the successor.

.. image:: task_dependencies/task-dependency.png
   :scale: 80%
   :alt: Task dependency

Odoo automatically manages task progress based on their dependency. Successor tasks are assigned the
:guilabel:`Waiting` status and cannot be moved to :guilabel:`In Progress` until their predecessor
task(s) are marked as :guilabel:`Approved`, :guilabel:`Cancelled`, or :guilabel:`Done`.

Remove dependencies
===================

To remove a task dependency, proceed as follows:

- From the task form, go to the **Blocked by** tab and click the :icon:`fa-times`
  (:guilabel:`times`) button.
- From the Gantt view, click the red :icon:`fa-times` (:guilabel:`times`) button that appears at the
  center of the arrow when you hover your mouse over it.

Task stages and statuses
========================

Task stages
===========

Task stages are displayed as columns in the project's Kanban view, and allow you to update the
progress of its tasks with a drag-and-drop. In most projects, the stages will be akin to **New**,
**In progress**, **Backlog**, etc.

By default, task stages are project-specific but can be shared across multiple projects that follow
the same workflow.

Creating task stages
--------------------

Odoo Project doesn’t provide default stages but instead allows you to create custom stages tailored
to your specific business needs. You are prompted to do so immediately after :ref:`creating a new
project <project_management/configuration>`.

To create a stage, type its name into the :guilabel:`Stage...` field, then click :guilabel:`Add`.

.. tip::
   Click :guilabel:`See examples` to find ideas for stage names applicable to your line of business.

Editing task stages
-------------------

To edit the task stage, click the :icon:`fa-cog` (:guilabel:`cog`) icon next to its name. From
there, click one of the following:

 - :guilabel:`Fold`: to hide the task stage and all of the tasks in this stage from the Kanban view.
 - :guilabel:`Edit`:

   - :guilabel:`Name`: to change the name of the stage.
   - :guilabel:`SMS/Email Template`: to automatically send an email or SMS notification to the
     customer when a task reaches this stage.
   - :guilabel:`Folded in Kanban`: to hide the task stage and all of the tasks in this stage from
     the Kanban view.
   - :guilabel:`Projects`: to share this task stage between several projects.
   - :guilabel:`Automations`: to create :doc:`custom rules that trigger automatic actions
     <../../../studio/automated_actions>` (e.g., creating activities, adding followers, or sending
     webhook notifications). Note that this will activate Studio in your database, which may impact
     your pricing plan.

 - :guilabel:`Delete`: to delete this stage.
 - :guilabel:`Archive/Unarchive all`: to archive or unarchive all of the tasks in this stage.

.. _project/tasks/task_stages_statuses/statuses:

Task statuses
=============

Task statuses are used to track the status of tasks within the Kanban stage, as well as to close the
task when it’s done or canceled. Unlike Kanban stages, they cannot be customized; five task statuses
exist in Odoo and are used as follows:

 - :guilabel:`In Progress`: this is the default state of all tasks, meaning that work required for
   the task to move to the next Kanban stage is ongoing.
 - :guilabel:`Changes Requested`: to highlight that changes, either requested by the customer or
   internally, are needed before the task is moved to the next Kanban stage.
 - :guilabel:`Approved`: to highlight that the task is ready to be moved to the next stage.
 - :guilabel:`Canceled`: to cancel the task.
 - :guilabel:`Done`: to close the task once it's been completed.

.. note::

   - The :guilabel:`Changes Requested` and :guilabel:`Approved` task statuses are cleared as soon as
     the task is moved to another Kanban stage. The task status reverts to the default :guilabel:`In
     Progress` status so that :guilabel:`Changes Requested` or :guilabel:`Approved` status can be
     applied again once the necessary work has been completed in this Kanban stage.
   - The :guilabel:`Done` and :guilabel:`Canceled` statuses are independent from the Kanban stage.
     Once a task is marked as :guilabel:`Done` or :guilabel:`Canceled`, it is closed. If needed, it
     can be reopened by changing its status.

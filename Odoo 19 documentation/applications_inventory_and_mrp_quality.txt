Failure locations
=================

.. |QCP| replace:: :abbr:`QCP (Quality Control Point)`
.. |QCPs| replace:: :abbr:`QCP (Quality Control Points)`

In Odoo, *quality control points* (QCPs) are used to create *quality checks*, which prompt employees
to confirm the quality of products, when they are included in certain operations. By setting one or
more *failure locations* on a |QCP|, products that fail the quality checks it creates can be sent to
one of the specified locations.

.. important::
   The *Failure Location* feature was added in version 17.0 of Odoo, and does **not** appear in any
   previous version. To upgrade an Odoo database to a more recent version, see the documentation on
   :doc:`database upgrades <../../../../administration/upgrade>`.

Configuration
=============

To use failure locations, the *Storage Locations* setting **must** be enabled in the settings of the
*Inventory* app. This setting allows for the creation of sub-locations within a warehouse, including
failure locations.

To enable the *Storage Locations* setting, navigate to :menuselection:`Inventory app -->
Configuration --> Settings`, and tick the checkbox next to :guilabel:`Storage Locations`, under the
:guilabel:`Warehouses` heading. Then, click :guilabel:`Save`.

.. image:: failure_locations/storage-locations-setting.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The Storage Locations setting on the Inventory app settings page.

.. important::
   Failure locations are most effective when used for products configured as *storable products*.
   This is because inventory counts are only tracked for storable products, versus *consumable*
   products, for which exact counts are not tracked.

   Quality checks can still be created for consumable products, and those products can be sent to a
   failure location if they fail a check. However, Odoo does not track the exact quantity of a
   consumable product stored at a failure location.

   To configure a product as storable, navigate to :menuselection:`Inventory app --> Products -->
   Products`, and select a product. In the :guilabel:`Product Type` field on the :guilabel:`General
   Information` tab, make sure that :guilabel:`Storable Product` is selected from the drop-down
   menu.

Add failure location to QCP
===========================

To add a failure location to a |QCP|, navigate to :menuselection:`Quality app --> Quality Control
--> Control Points`. Select an existing |QCP| from the list, or create a new one by clicking
:guilabel:`New`.

.. note::
   The following instructions only detail the configuration settings necessary for adding a failure
   location to a |QCP|. For a full overview of |QCPs| and all of the options available when
   configuring them, see the documentation on :doc:`quality control points
   <quality_control_points>`.

In the :guilabel:`Control Per` field on the |QCP| form, select the :guilabel:`Quantity` option.
Doing so causes a :guilabel:`Failure Locations` field to appear on the form. This field is only
available when the :guilabel:`Quantity` option is selected.

In the :guilabel:`Failure Locations` field, select one or more locations from the drop-down menu. To
create a new location, type the desired location name into the field, and then select
:guilabel:`Create "[name]"` from the drop-down menu.

.. image:: failure_locations/qcp-form.png
   :align: center
   :alt: A QCP form in the Quality app, configured with a failure location.

Send products to failure location
=================================

Once a |QCP| has been configured with one or more failure locations, products that fail a check
created by the |QCP| can be routed to one of the locations.

To do so, open an order that requires a quality check created by a |QCP| configured with a failure
location. For example, navigate to :menuselection:`Inventory app --> Operations --> Receipts`, and
select a receipt.

At the top of the selected order, click the :guilabel:`Quality Checks` button to open a pop-up
window, from which the quality check can be processed. At the bottom of the pop-up window, click the
:guilabel:`Fail` button to fail the quality check, which opens a second pop-up window, titled
:guilabel:`Quality Check Failed for [Product]`.

In the :guilabel:`Quantity Failed` field, enter the quantity of the product that failed to pass the
quality check. In the :guilabel:`Failure Location` field, select a location to which the failed
quantity should be sent. Then, click :guilabel:`Confirm` at the bottom of the pop-up window to close
it.

.. image:: failure_locations/failed-pop-up.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The pop-up window that appears after a quality check fails.

Finally, on the order, click the :guilabel:`Validate` button at the top of the page. Doing so
confirms the products that failed the quality check were sent to the failure location, while
products that passed it were sent to their normal storage locations.

View failure location inventory
===============================

To view the product quantities stored in a failure location, navigate to :menuselection:`Inventory
app --> Configuration --> Locations`. Select a failure location from the list. Then, click the
:guilabel:`Current Stock` smart button on the location's page.

A failure location's page lists all of the products stored within the location, along with the
quantity of each.

Instructions quality check
==========================

.. |MO| replace:: :abbr:`MO (Manufacturing Order)`
.. |QCP| replace:: :abbr:`QCP (Quality Control Point)`

In Odoo *Quality*, an *Instructions* check is one of the quality check types that can be selected
when creating a new quality check or quality control point (QCP). *Instructions* checks consist of a
text entry field that allows the creator to provide instructions for how to complete the check.

For a full overview of how to configure a quality check or a |QCP|, see the documentation on
:ref:`quality checks <quality/quality_management/quality-checks>` and :ref:`quality control points
<quality/quality_management/quality-control-points>`.

Process an Instructions quality check
=====================================

There are multiple ways that *Instructions* quality checks can be processed. If a quality check is
assigned to a specific manufacturing, inventory, or work order, the check can be processed on the
order itself. Alternatively, a check can be processed from the check's page.

Process from the quality check's page
-------------------------------------

To process an *Instructions* quality check from the check's page, begin by navigating to
:menuselection:`Quality --> Quality Control --> Quality Checks`, and select a quality check. Follow
the :guilabel:`Instructions` for how to complete the check.

If the product passes the check, click the :guilabel:`Pass` button above the quality check form. If
the product does not pass the check, click the :guilabel:`Fail` button, instead.

Process quality check on an order
---------------------------------

To process an *Instructions* quality check on an order, select a manufacturing order or inventory
order (receipt, delivery, return, etc.) for which a check is required. Manufacturing orders can be
selected by navigating to :menuselection:`Manufacturing --> Operations --> Manufacturing Orders`,
and clicking on an order. Inventory orders can be selected by navigating to
:menuselection:`Inventory`, clicking the :guilabel:`# To Process` button on an operation card, and
selecting an order.

On the selected manufacturing or inventory order, a purple :guilabel:`Quality Checks` button appears
above the order. Click the button to open the :guilabel:`Quality Check` pop-up window, from which
any quality checks created for the order can be processed.

.. image:: instructions_check/quality-check-pop-up.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The Quality Check pop-up window on a manufacturing or inventory order.

To complete an *Instructions* quality check, follow the instructions detailed in the
:guilabel:`Quality Check` pop-up window. Finally, click :guilabel:`Validate` to confirm that the
check has been completed.

If an issue or defect is found during the quality check, a quality alert may need to be created to
notify a quality team. To do so, click the :guilabel:`Quality Alert` button that appears at the top
of the manufacturing or inventory order after the check is validated.

Clicking :guilabel:`Quality Alert` opens a quality alert form on a new page. For a complete guide on
how to fill out quality alert forms, view the documentation on :ref:`quality alerts
<quality/quality_management/quality-alerts>`.

Process work order quality check
--------------------------------

When configuring a |QCP| that is triggered by a manufacturing order, a specific work order can also
be specified in the :guilabel:`Work Order Operation` field on the |QCP| form. If a work order is
specified, an *Instructions* quality check is created for that specific work order, rather than the
|MO| as a whole.

Quality checks configured for work orders **must** be completed from the *Shop Floor* module. To do
so, begin by navigating to :menuselection:`Manufacturing --> Operations --> Manufacturing Orders`.
Select an |MO| that includes a work order for which an *Instructions* quality check is required.

On the |MO|, select the :guilabel:`Work Orders` tab, and click the :guilabel:`Open Work Order
(square with arrow coming out of it)` button on the line of the work order to be processed. On the
resulting :guilabel:`Work Orders` pop-up window, click the :guilabel:`Open Shop Floor` button to
open the *Shop Floor* module.

When accessed from a specific work order, the *Shop Floor* module opens to the page for the work
center where the order is configured to be processed, and isolates the work order's card so that no
other cards are shown.

Begin processing the work order's steps until the *Instructions* quality check step is reached.
Click on the step to open a pop-up window that details how to complete the quality check. Once
completed, click the :guilabel:`Next` button to complete the check, and move on to the next step.

.. image:: instructions_check/instructions-check-shop-floor.png
   :align: center
   :alt: An Instruction check as it appears in the Shop Floor module.

Alternatively, an *Instructions* quality check can be completed by clicking the checkbox that
appears on the right side of the step's line on the work order card. When using this method, the
quality check automatically passes, without a pop-up window appearing.

.. note::
   For a full guide to the *Shop Floor* module, see the :ref:`Shop Floor overview
   <manufacturing/shop_floor/shop_floor_overview>` documentation.

Measure quality check
=====================

.. |MO| replace:: :abbr:`MO (Manufacturing Order)`
.. |QCP| replace:: :abbr:`QCP (Quality Control Point)`
.. |QCPs| replace:: :abbr:`QCPs (Quality Control Points)`

In Odoo *Quality*, a *Measure* check is one of the quality check types that can be selected when
creating a new quality check or quality control point (QCP). *Measure* checks prompt users to
measure a certain aspect of a product and record the measurement in Odoo. For the quality check to
pass, the recorded measurement must be within a certain *tolerance* of a *norm* value.

Create a Measure quality check
==============================

There are two distinct ways that *Measure* quality checks can be created. A single check can be
manually created. Alternatively, a |QCP| can be configured that automatically creates checks at a
predetermined interval.

This documentation only details the configuration options that are unique to *Measure* quality
checks and |QCPs|. For a full overview of all the configuration options available when creating a
single check or a |QCP|, see the documentation on :ref:`quality checks
<quality/quality_management/quality-checks>` and :ref:`quality control points
<quality/quality_management/quality-control-points>`.

Quality check
-------------

To create a single *Measure* quality check, navigate to :menuselection:`Quality --> Quality Control
--> Quality Checks`, and click :guilabel:`New`. Fill out the new quality check form as follows:

- In the :guilabel:`Type` drop-down field, select the :guilabel:`Measure` quality check type.
- In the :guilabel:`Team` drop-down field, select the quality team responsible for managing the
  check.
- In the :guilabel:`Instructions` text field of the :guilabel:`Notes` tab, enter instructions for
  how the picture should be taken.

.. image:: measure_check/measure-check-form-1.png

   :alt: A quality check form configured for a Measure quality check.

Quality control point (QCP)
---------------------------

To create a |QCP| that generates *Measure* quality checks automatically, navigate to
:menuselection:`Quality --> Quality Control --> Control Points`, and click :guilabel:`New`. Fill out
the new |QCP| form as follows:

- In the :guilabel:`Type` drop-down field, select the :guilabel:`Measure` quality check type. Doing
  so causes two new fields to appear: :guilabel:`Norm` and :guilabel:`Tolerance`.

  - Use the first text-entry field of the :guilabel:`Norm` field to record the ideal measurement
    that the product should conform to. Use the second text-entry field to specify the unit of
    measurement that should be used.
  - The :guilabel:`Tolerance` field features two sub-fields: :guilabel:`from` and :guilabel:`to`.
    Use the :guilabel:`from` field to specify the minimum acceptable measurement, and the
    :guilabel:`to` field to specify the maximum acceptable measurement.

- In the :guilabel:`Team` drop-down field, select the quality team responsible for managing the
  checks created by the |QCP|.
- In the :guilabel:`Instructions` text field, enter instructions for how the measurement should be
  taken.

Process a Measure quality check
===============================

Once created, there are multiple ways that *Measure* quality checks can be processed. If a quality
check is assigned to a specific inventory, manufacturing, or work order, the check can be processed
on the order itself. Alternatively, a check can be processed from the check's page.

From the check's page
---------------------

To process a *Measure* quality check from the check's page, begin by navigating to
:menuselection:`Quality --> Quality Control --> Quality Checks`, and select a quality check. Follow
the :guilabel:`Instructions` for how to take the measurement.

After taking the measurement, record the value in the :guilabel:`Measure` field on the quality check
form. To manually pass or fail the check, click :guilabel:`Pass` or :guilabel:`Fail` at the top-left
corner of the check.

Alternatively, if the quality check is assigned to a |QCP| for which *norm* and *tolerance* values
have been specified, click :guilabel:`Measure` at the top-left corner of the check instead. Doing so
automatically marks the check as *Passed* if the recorded value is within the specified *tolerance*,
or *Failed* if the value is outside of it.

On an order
-----------

To process a *Measure* quality check on an order, select a manufacturing order or inventory order
(receipt, delivery, return, etc.), for which a check is required. Manufacturing orders can be
selected by navigating to :menuselection:`Manufacturing --> Operations --> Manufacturing Orders`,
and clicking on an order. Inventory orders can be selected by navigating to
:menuselection:`Inventory`, clicking the :guilabel:`# To Process` button on an operation card, and
selecting an order.

On the selected manufacturing or inventory order, a purple :guilabel:`Quality Checks` button appears
at the top of the page. Click the button to open the :guilabel:`Quality Check` pop-up window, which
shows all of the quality checks required for that order.

To process a *Measure* quality check, measure the product as instructed, then enter the value in the
:guilabel:`Measure` field on the pop-up window. Finally, click :guilabel:`Validate` to register the
recorded value.

.. image:: measure_check/measure-check-pop-up.png
   :align: center
   :alt: A Measure quality check pop-up window on a manufacturing or inventory order.

If the value entered is within the range specified in the :guilabel:`Tolerance` section of the
|QCP|, the quality check passes and the pop-up window closes. The rest of the manufacturing or
inventory order can then be processed as usual.

However, if the value entered is outside of the specified range, a new pop-up window appears, titled
:guilabel:`Quality Check Failed`. The body of the pop-up shows a warning message that states,
:guilabel:`You measured # units and it should be between # units and # units.`, as well as the
instructions entered in the :guilabel:`Message If Failure` tab of the |QCP|. At the bottom of the
pop-up, two buttons appear: :guilabel:`Correct Measure` and :guilabel:`Confirm Measure`.

.. image:: measure_check/measure-check-failed.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The "Quality Check Failed" pop-up window.

If the measurement was not entered correctly and should be changed, select :guilabel:`Correct
Measure`. Doing so re-opens the :guilabel:`Quality Check` pop-up window. Enter the corrected
measurement in the :guilabel:`Measure` field, and then click :guilabel:`Validate` to complete the
check.

If the measurement was entered correctly, click :guilabel:`Confirm Measure` instead, and the quality
check fails. Follow any instructions that were listed on the :guilabel:`Quality Check Failed` pop-up
window.

If a quality alert must be created, click the :guilabel:`Quality Alert` button that appears at the
top of the manufacturing or inventory order after the check fails. Clicking :guilabel:`Quality
Alert` opens a quality alert form on a new page.

.. seealso::
   For a complete guide on how to fill out the quality alert form, view the documentation on
   :doc:`quality alerts <../quality_management/quality_alerts>`.

On a work order
---------------

When configuring a |QCP| that is triggered during manufacturing, a specific work order can also be
specified in the :guilabel:`Work Order Operation` field on the |QCP| form. If a work order is
specified, a *Measure* quality check is created for that specific work order, rather than the
manufacturing order as a whole.

*Measure* quality checks configured for work orders **must** be completed from the *Shop Floor*
module. To do so, begin by navigating to :menuselection:`Manufacturing --> Operations -->
Manufacturing Orders`. Select an |MO| that includes a work order for which a *Measure* quality check
is required.

On the |MO|, select the :guilabel:`Work Orders` tab, and click the :guilabel:`Open Work Order
(external link icon)` button on the line of the work order to be processed. On the resulting
:guilabel:`Work Orders` pop-up window, click the :guilabel:`Open Shop Floor` button to open the
*Shop Floor* module.

When accessed from a specific work order, the *Shop Floor* module opens to the page for the work
center where the order is configured to be processed, and isolates the work order's card, so no
other cards are shown.

Process the work order's steps until the *Measure* quality check step is reached. Click on the step
to open a pop-up window that includes instructions for how the measurement should be taken. After
taking the measurement, enter it in the :guilabel:`Measure` field of the pop-up window, and then
click :guilabel:`Validate`.

.. image:: measure_check/measure-check-shop-floor.png
   :align: center
   :alt: A Measure check in the Shop Floor module.

If the measurement entered is within the range specified in the :guilabel:`Tolerance` section of the
|QCP|, the quality check passes, and the pop-up window moves on to the next step of the work order.
However, if the measurement entered is outside of the specified range, a new pop-up window appears,
titled :guilabel:`Quality Check Failed`.

The body of the :guilabel:`Quality Check Failed` pop-up window shows a message that states,
:guilabel:`You measured # units and it should be between # units and # units`, as well as the
instructions entered in the :guilabel:`Message If Failure` tab of the |QCP|. At the bottom of the
pop-up window, two buttons appear: :guilabel:`Correct Measure` and :guilabel:`Confirm Measure`.

.. image:: measure_check/shop-floor-measure-check-failed.png

   :alt: The Quality Check Failed pop-up window for a Measure check in the Shop Floor module.

If the measurement was not entered correctly, and should be changed, select :guilabel:`Correct
Measure`. Doing so opens a new pop-up window, titled :guilabel:`Quality Check`. Enter the corrected
measure in the :guilabel:`Measure` field, and then click :guilabel:`Validate` to complete the check
and close the pop-up window.

If the measurement was entered correctly, click :guilabel:`Confirm Measure` instead, and the quality
check fails. Follow any instructions that were listed on the :guilabel:`Quality Check Failed` pop-up
window.

If a quality alert must be created, exit the pop-up window by clicking the :guilabel:`X (close)`
button in the top-right corner.

Then, click the :guilabel:`⋮ (three vertical dots)` button on the bottom-right corner of the work
order card to open the :guilabel:`What do you want to do?` pop-up window.

Process a Take a Picture quality check
======================================

Once created, there are multiple ways that *Take a Picture* quality checks can be processed. If a
quality check is assigned to a specific inventory, manufacturing, or work order, the check can be
processed on the order itself. Alternatively, a check can be processed from the check's page.

From the check's page
---------------------

To process a *Take a Picture* quality check from the check's page, begin by navigating to
:menuselection:`Quality --> Quality Control --> Quality Checks`, and then select a quality check.
Follow the :guilabel:`Instructions` for how to take the picture.

After taking the picture, make sure it is stored on the device being used to process the quality
check (computer, tablet, etc.). Then, click the :guilabel:`✏️ (pencil)` button in the
:guilabel:`Picture` section to open the device's file manager. In the file manager, navigate to the
picture, select it, and click :guilabel:`Open` to attach it.

   :align: center
   :alt: The edit button (pencil) on a Take a Picture quality check.

On an order
-----------

To process a *Take a Picture* quality check on an order, select a manufacturing order or inventory
order (receipt, delivery, return, etc.), for which a check is required. Manufacturing orders can be
selected by navigating to :menuselection:`Manufacturing --> Operations --> Manufacturing Orders`,
and clicking on an order. Inventory orders can be selected by navigating to
:menuselection:`Inventory`, clicking the :guilabel:`# To Process` button on an operation card, and
selecting an order.

On the selected manufacturing or inventory order, a purple :guilabel:`Quality Checks` button appears
at the top of the page. Click the button to open the :guilabel:`Quality Check` pop-up window, which
shows all of the quality checks required for that order.

Follow the instructions detailing how to take the picture, which are shown on the :guilabel:`Quality
Check` pop-up window. After taking the picture, make sure it is stored on the device being used to
process the quality check (computer, tablet, etc.).

Then, click the :guilabel:`Take a Picture` button in the :guilabel:`Picture` section to open the
device's file manager. In the file manager, navigate to the picture, select it, and click
:guilabel:`Open` to attach it. Finally, click :guilabel:`Validate` on the :guilabel:`Quality Check`
pop-up window to complete the quality check.

   :alt: A Take a Picture quality check pop-up window on a manufacturing or inventory order.

If a quality alert must be created, click the :guilabel:`Quality Alert` button that appears at the
top of the manufacturing or inventory order after the check is validated. Clicking
:guilabel:`Quality Alert` opens a quality alert form on a new page. For a complete guide on how to
fill out quality alert forms, view the documentation on :ref:`quality alerts
<quality/quality_management/quality-alerts>`.

On a work order
---------------

When configuring a |QCP| that is triggered during manufacturing, a specific work order can also be
specified in the :guilabel:`Work Order Operation` field on the |QCP| form. If a work order is
specified, a *Take a Picture* quality check is created for that specific work order, rather than the
manufacturing order as a whole.

*Take a Picture* quality checks configured for work orders **must** be completed from the *Shop
Floor* module. To do so, begin by navigating to :menuselection:`Manufacturing --> Operations -->
Manufacturing Orders`. Then, select an |MO| that includes a work order for which a *Take a Picture*
quality check is required.

On the |MO|, select the :guilabel:`Work Orders` tab, and then click the :guilabel:`Open Work Order
(external link icon)` button on the line of the work order to be processed. On the resulting
:guilabel:`Work Orders` pop-up window, click the :guilabel:`Open Shop Floor` button to open the
*Shop Floor* module.

When accessed from a specific work order, the *Shop Floor* module opens to the page for the work
center where the order is configured to be processed, and isolates the work order's card, so no
other cards are shown.

Process the work order's steps until the *Take a Picture* quality check step is reached. Click on
the step to open a pop-up window that includes instructions for how the picture should be taken.
After taking the picture, make sure it is stored on the device being used to process the quality
check (computer, tablet, etc.).

Then, click the :guilabel:`Take a Picture` button on the pop-up window to open the device's file
manager. In the file manager, navigate to the picture, select it, and click :guilabel:`Open` to
attach it.

Finally, click :guilabel:`Validate` at the bottom of the pop-up window to complete the quality
check. The pop-up window then moves on to the next step of the work order.

.. image:: picture_check/picture-check-shop-floor.png
   :align: center
   :alt: A Take a Picture check in the Shop Floor module.

If a quality alert must be created, exit the pop-up window by clicking the :guilabel:`X (close)`
button in the top-right corner.

Then, click the :guilabel:`⋮ (three vertical dots)` button on the bottom-right corner of the work
order card to open the :guilabel:`What do you want to do?` pop-up window.

On the :guilabel:`What do you want to do?` pop-up window, select the :guilabel:`Create a Quality
Alert` button. Doing so opens a blank quality alert form in a new :guilabel:`Quality Alerts` pop-up
window.

.. seealso::
   For a complete guide on how to fill out quality alert forms, view the documentation on
   :doc:`quality alerts <../quality_management/quality_alerts>`.

Review picture attached to quality check
========================================

After a picture has been attached to a check, it can then be reviewed by quality team members or
other users. To do so, navigate to :menuselection:`Quality --> Quality Control --> Quality Checks`,
and select a quality check to review.

The attached picture appears in the :guilabel:`Picture` section of the quality check form. After
reviewing the picture, click the :guilabel:`Pass` button if the check passes, or the
:guilabel:`Fail` button if the check fails.

Quality alerts
==============

.. _quality/quality_management/quality-alerts:
.. |MO| replace:: :abbr:`MO (Manufacturing Order)`

In the Odoo *Quality* app, *quality alerts* are used to notify quality teams of product defects or
other issues. Quality alerts can be created from a manufacturing or inventory order, from a work
order in the *Shop Floor* module, or directly within the *Quality* app.

Create quality alerts
=====================

There are multiple ways to create a new quality alert:

- **From the Quality app itself**, by to :menuselection:`Quality -->  Quality Control --> Quality
  Alerts`, and then click :guilabel:`New` to open a quality alert form.
- Navigate to :menuselection:`Manufacturing --> Operations --> Manufacturing Orders`, and then
  select an |MO|. Click the :guilabel:`Quality Alert` button at the top of the |MO| to open a
  quality alert form in a new page.

  .. important::
     This method can only be used if a quality check has been requested for the |MO|. The
     :guilabel:`Quality Alert` button will not appear otherwise.

- Open the :menuselection:`Inventory` app, click the :guilabel:`# To Process` button on an inventory
  order type card (Receipts, Delivery Orders, etc.), and then select an order. Click the
  :guilabel:`Quality Alert` button at the top of the order to open a quality alert form in a new
  page.

  .. important::
     This method can only be used if a quality check has been requested for the inventory order. The
     :guilabel:`Quality Alert` button will not appear otherwise. If the button does not appear, a
     quality alert can also be created by clicking the :guilabel:`⚙️ (gear)` icon at the top of the
     page and selecting the :guilabel:`Quality Alert` option from the resulting menu.

- Open the :menuselection:`Shop Floor` module, and then select a work center from the navigation bar
  at the top of the page. Then, click the :guilabel:`⋮ (three vertical dots)` button at the
  bottom-right of a work order card to open the :guilabel:`What do you want to do?` menu. Select the
  :guilabel:`Create a Quality Alert` option from this menu to open a quality alert in a pop-up
  window.

.. note::
   Depending on how a new quality alert form is opened, certain fields on the form may already be
   filled in. For example, if a quality alert is created from a work order card in the *Shop Floor*
   module, the :guilabel:`Product` and :guilabel:`Work Center` are pre-filled.

Quality alerts form
-------------------

After opening a new quality alert form, begin by giving it a short :guilabel:`Title` that summarizes
the issue with the product.

Then, if the quality alert is referencing:

- **A specific product or product variant**, select it from the :guilabel:`Product` or
  :guilabel:`Product Variant` drop-down menus.
- **A specific work center**, select it from the :guilabel:`Work Center` drop-down menu.
- **A specific picking order**, select it from the :guilabel:`Picking` drop-down menu.

Next in the :guilabel:`Team` field, select the quality team that is responsible for managing the
quality alert. If a specific employee should be responsible for the quality alert, select them from
the :guilabel:`Responsible` drop-down menu.

In the :guilabel:`Tags` field, select any tags relevant to the quality alert from the drop-down
menu.

Use the :guilabel:`Root Cause` field to select the cause of the quality issue, if known.

Lastly, choose a :guilabel:`Priority` level by selecting a :guilabel:`⭐ (star)` number between one
and three. Quality alerts with higher priorities appear at the top of the :guilabel:`Quality Alerts`
Kanban board in the *Quality* app.

At the bottom of the quality alert form are four tabs which aid in adding supplemental information
or actions to be taken for the quality alert. They can be filled out as follows:

- In the :guilabel:`Description` tab, enter a description of the quality issue.
- Use the :guilabel:`Corrective Actions` tab to detail the steps that should be taken to fix the
  issue.
- Use the :guilabel:`Preventive Actions` tab to detail what should be done to prevent the issue from
  occurring in the future.
- In the :guilabel:`Miscellaneous` tab, select the :guilabel:`Vendor` of the product. If using an
  Odoo database which manages multiple companies, select the relevant company in the
  :guilabel:`Company` field. Finally, specify when the alert was assigned to a quality team in the
  :guilabel:`Date Assigned` field.

.. image:: quality_alerts/alert-form.png
   :align: center
   :alt: A quality alert form that has been filled out.

Manage quality alerts
=====================

To view all existing quality alerts, navigate to :menuselection:`Quality --> Quality Control -->
Quality Alerts`. By default, alerts are displayed in a Kanban board view, which organizes them into
different stages based on where they are in the review process.

To move an alert to a different stage, simply drag and drop it on the desired stage. Alternatively,
select a quality alert to open it, and then click the desired stage above the top-right corner of
the quality alert form.

To create a new alert within a specific stage, click the :guilabel:`+ (plus)` button to the right of
the stage name. In the new alert card that appears below the stage title, enter the
:guilabel:`Title` of the alert, and then click :guilabel:`Add`. To configure the rest of the alert,
select the alert card to open its form.

.. _quality/quality_management/quality-checks:
.. |MO| replace:: :abbr:`MO (Manufacturing Order)`
.. |QCP| replace:: :abbr:`QCP (Quality Control Point)`

Quality checks are manual inspections conducted by employees, and are used to ensure the quality of
products. In Odoo, a quality check can be conducted for a single product, or multiple products
within the same inventory operation or manufacturing order.

Using a Quality Control Point (QCP), it is possible to create quality checks automatically at
regular intervals. When quality checks are created by a |QCP|, they appear on a manufacturing or
inventory order, where the employee processing the order will be prompted to complete them. For a
full explanation of how to create and configure a |QCP|, see the documentation on :ref:`quality
control points <quality/quality_management/quality-control-points>`.

While quality checks are most commonly created automatically by a |QCP|, it is also possible to
manually create a single quality check. Creating a check manually is useful when an employee wants
to schedule a quality check that will only occur once, or register a quality check that they conduct
unprompted.

Manual quality check
====================

To manually create a single quality check, navigate to :menuselection:`Quality --> Quality Control
--> Quality Checks`, and click :guilabel:`New`. On the quality check form, begin by selecting an
option from the :guilabel:`Control per` drop-down menu:

- :guilabel:`Operation` requests a check for an entire operation (ex. delivery order) and all
  products within it.
- :guilabel:`Product` requests a check for every unit of a product that is part of an operation (ex.
  every unit of a product within a delivery order).
- :guilabel:`Quantity` requests a check for every quantity of a product that is part of an operation
  (ex. one check for five units of a product within a delivery order). Selecting
  :guilabel:`Quantity` also causes a :guilabel:`Lot/Serial` drop-down field to appear, from which
  can be selected a specific lot or serial number that the quality check should be conducted for.

Next, select an inventory operation from the :guilabel:`Picking` drop-down menu or a manufacturing
order from the :guilabel:`Production Order` drop-down menu. This is necessary because Odoo needs to
know for which operation the quality check is being conducted.

If the quality check should be assigned to a specific |QCP|, select it from the :guilabel:`Control
Point` drop-down menu. This is useful if the quality check is being created manually, but should
still be recognized as belonging to a specific |QCP|.

Select a quality check type from the :guilabel:`Type` drop-down field:

- :guilabel:`Instructions` provides specific instructions for how to conduct the quality check.
- :guilabel:`Take a Picture` requires a picture to be attached to the check before the check can be
  completed.
- :guilabel:`Print label` opens a pop-up from which labels can be printed. This step can be
  customized to provide instructions about where to add the labels on a product.
- :guilabel:`Pass - Fail` is used when the product being checked must meet a certain criteria to
  pass the check.
- Selecting :guilabel:`Measure` causes a :guilabel:`Measure` input field to appear, in which a
  measurement must be entered before the check can be completed.
- Selecting :guilabel:`Worksheet` causes a :guilabel:`Quality Template` drop-down field to appear.
  Use it to select a quality worksheet that must be filled out to complete the check.

In the :guilabel:`Team` field, select the quality team that is responsible for the quality check. In
the :guilabel:`Company` field, select the company that owns the product being inspected.

On the :guilabel:`Notes` tab at the bottom of the form, enter any relevant instructions in the
:guilabel:`Instructions` text entry box (ex. 'Attach a picture of the product'). In the
:guilabel:`Notes` text entry box, enter any relevant information about the quality check (who
created it, why it was created, etc.).

Finally, if the check is being processed immediately, click the :guilabel:`Pass` button at the top
left of the screen if the check passes, or the :guilabel:`Fail` button if the check fails.

.. image:: quality_checks/quality-check-form.png
   :align: center
   :alt: A quality check form filled out for a Pass - Fail check.

Process quality check
=====================

Quality checks can be processed directly on the quality check's page, or from a manufacturing or
inventory order for which a check is required. Alternatively, if a quality check is created for a
specific work order operation, the check is processed in the *Shop Floor* module.

.. note::
   It is not possible to manually create a single quality check that is assigned to a specific work
   order operation. Quality checks for work order operations can only be created by a |QCP|. See the
   documentation on :ref:`Quality Control Points
   <quality/quality_management/quality-control-points>` for information about how to configure a
   |QCP| that will create quality checks for a specific work order operation.

Quality check page
------------------

To process a quality check from the check's page, begin by navigating to :menuselection:`Quality -->
Quality Control --> Quality Checks`, then select the check to process. Follow the instructions for
how to complete the check, listed in the :guilabel:`Instructions` field of the :guilabel:`Notes` tab
at the bottom of the page.

If the quality check passes, click the :guilabel:`Pass` button at the top of the page. If the check
fails, click the :guilabel:`Fail` button, instead.

Quality check on order
----------------------

To process a quality check on an order, select a manufacturing or inventory order (receipt,
delivery, return, etc.), for which a check is required. Manufacturing orders can be selected by
navigating to :menuselection:`Manufacturing --> Operations --> Manufacturing Orders`, and clicking
on an order. Inventory orders can be selected by navigating to :menuselection:`Inventory`, clicking
the :guilabel:`# To Process` button on an operation card, and selecting an order.

On the selected inventory or manufacturing order, a purple :guilabel:`Quality Checks` button appears
at the top of the order. Click the button to open the :guilabel:`Quality Check` pop-up window, which
shows all of the quality checks required for that order.

Follow the instructions that appear on the :guilabel:`Quality Check` pop-up window. If a Pass - Fail
check is being processed, complete the check by clicking :guilabel:`Pass` or :guilabel:`Fail` at the
bottom of the pop-up window. For all other quality check types, a :guilabel:`Validate` button
appears instead. Click it to complete the check.

.. image:: quality_checks/quality-check-pop-up.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The "Quality Check" pop-up window on a manufacturing order.

Quality check on work order
---------------------------

To process a quality check for a work order, begin by navigating to :menuselection:`Manufacturing
--> Operations --> Manufacturing Orders`. Select an |MO| that includes a work order for which a
quality check is required.

On the |MO|, select the :guilabel:`Work Orders` tab, and then click the :guilabel:`Open Work Order
(external link icon)` button on the line of the work order to be processed. On the resulting
:guilabel:`Work Orders` pop-up window, click the :guilabel:`Open Shop Floor` button to open the
*Shop Floor* module.

.. seealso::
   For a full guide to the Shop Floor module, see the :doc:`Shop Floor overview
   <../../manufacturing/shop_floor/shop_floor_overview>` documentation.

When accessed from a specific work order, the *Shop Floor* module opens to the page for the work
center where the order is configured to be processed, and isolates the work order's card so that no
other cards are shown.

Process the work order's steps until the quality check step is reached. Click on the step to open a
pop-up window that details how the check should be completed. After following the instructions,
click :guilabel:`Validate` to complete the check. Alternatively, if a *Pass - Fail* check is being
processed, click either the :guilabel:`Pass` or :guilabel:`Fail` button.

It is also possible to complete a quality check by clicking the checkbox on the right side of the
step. Doing so automatically marks the check as *Passed*.

.. note::
   The specific steps for processing a quality check depend upon the type of check being conducted.
   For information about processing each type of quality check, see the associated documentation:

   - :doc:`../quality_check_types/instructions_check`
   - :doc:`../quality_check_types/pass_fail_check`

Quality control points
======================

.. _quality/quality_management/quality-control-points:
.. |MO| replace:: :abbr:`MO (Manufacturing Order)`
.. |MOs| replace:: :abbr:`MOs (Manufacturing Orders)`
.. |QCP| replace:: :abbr:`QCP (Quality Control Point)`
.. |QCPs| replace:: :abbr:`QCPs (Quality Control Points)`

In Odoo, *quality control points* (QCPs), are used to automatically create :doc:`quality checks
<quality_checks>` at predetermined intervals. |QCPs| can be configured to create quality checks for
specific operations (manufacturing, delivery, etc.), as well as specific products within those
operations.

Using |QCPs| allows quality teams to ensure products are being regularly inspected for defects and
other issues.

Configure quality control points
================================

To create a new |QCP|, navigate to :menuselection:`Quality --> Quality Control --> Control Points`,
and then click :guilabel:`New`.

Begin filling out the new |QCP| by entering a unique :guilabel:`Title` that makes the |QCP| easily
identifiable.

In the :guilabel:`Products` field, select one or more products the |QCP| should apply to. If the
|QCP| should apply to an entire product category, select it in the :guilabel:`Product Categories`
field.

In the :guilabel:`Operations` field, select the operation(s) that should trigger the |QCP|. For
example, selecting the :guilabel:`Manufacturing` option in the :guilabel:`Operations` field causes a
quality check to be created for new manufacturing orders (MOs).

.. note::
   When creating a new |QCP|, at least one operation must be listed in the :guilabel:`Operations`
   field. However, the :guilabel:`Products` and :guilabel:`Product Categories` fields can be left
   blank. If they are left blank, the |QCP| generates quality checks for every instance of the
   specified operation(s).

If the :guilabel:`Manufacturing` operation is selected in the :guilabel:`Operations` field, a new
field appears below it, titled :guilabel:`Work Order Operation`. From this field, select a specific
work order to generate quality checks for that operation, rather than the manufacturing operation,
in general.

.. example::
   A |QCP| could be configured to create quality checks for the `Assembly` work order of the `Coffee
   Table` product. Then, if a new |MO| is confirmed for a `Coffee Table`, the |QCP| creates a
   quality check specifically for the `Assembly` operation.

The :guilabel:`Control Per` field is set to one of three options that determine *when* a new quality
check is created:

- :guilabel:`Operation`: One check is requested for the specified operation, as a whole.
- :guilabel:`Product`: One check is requested for each *unique* product included in the specified
  operation. For example, a delivery operation for one table and four chairs would generate two
  checks, since two *unique* products are included in the operation.
- :guilabel:`Quantity`: A check is requested for a certain percentage of items within the specified
  operation. This percentage is set by enabling the :guilabel:`Partial Transfer Test` checkbox, and
  then entering a numerical value in the :guilabel:`Percentage` field that appears below. If the
  checkbox is not enabled, one quality check is created for the full quantity.

The :guilabel:`Control Frequency` field is set to one of three options that determine *how often* a
new quality check is created:

- :guilabel:`All`: A quality check is requested every time the conditions of the |QCP| are met.
- :guilabel:`Randomly`: A quality check is randomly requested for a certain percentage of
  operations, which can be specified in the :guilabel:`Every #% of Operations` field that appears
  below.
- :guilabel:`Periodically`: A quality check is requested once every set period of time, which is
  specified by entering a numerical value in the field below, and choosing either :guilabel:`Days`,
  :guilabel:`Weeks`, or :guilabel:`Months` as the desired time interval.

In the :guilabel:`Type` field, specify the type of quality check that should be performed. The
method for processing quality checks created by the |QCP| depends upon the type of quality check
selected:

- :guilabel:`Instructions` checks provide specific instructions for how to complete the quality
  check.
- :guilabel:`Take a Picture` checks require a picture of the product be uploaded for later review by
  the assigned quality team.
- :guilabel:`Register Production` checks prompt manufacturing employees to confirm the quantity of
  the product that was produced during the manufacturing operation.
- :guilabel:`Pass - Fail` checks specify a criterion that products must meet for the check to pass.
- :guilabel:`Measure` checks prompt employees to record a measurement of the product that must be
  within a tolerance of a norm value for the check to pass.
- :guilabel:`Worksheet` checks require the employee processing the check to fill out an interactive
  worksheet.
- :guilabel:`Spreadsheet` checks require the employee processing the check to fill out an
  interactive spreadsheet.

.. important::
   An *Instructions* check is the same as a step on a work order for an MO.

   When a step is added to a work order, Odoo stores it in the Quality app as a |QCP|. It is
   possible to manually create a |QCP| with the *Instructions* check type, and even assign it to an
   operation other than manufacturing, like receipts.

   However, when creating a control point specifically for quality control purposes, using a
   different check type is probably more effective.

.. note::
   When creating a |QCP| with the :guilabel:`Worksheet` or :guilabel:`Spreadsheet` check types, it
   is necessary to specify a *Quality Worksheet Template* or *Quality Spreadsheet Template* in the
   :guilabel:`Template` field that appears below the :guilabel:`Type` field.

   The selected template is duplicated for each quality check created by the |QCP|, and **must** be
   filled out to complete the quality check.

   To create a new template, navigate to :menuselection:`Quality app --> Configuration --> Quality
   Worksheet/Spreadsheet Templates`, and click :guilabel:`New`.

In the :guilabel:`Team` field, specify the quality team that is responsible for managing the |QCP|,
and the quality checks it creates. If a specific quality team member is responsible for the |QCP|,
select them in the :guilabel:`Responsible` field.

The :guilabel:`Step Document` field has two options that specify the location of an instructional
document detailing how to complete the quality checks created by the |QCP|.

Select :guilabel:`Specific Page of Operation Worksheet` if the document is included with the
instructional worksheet for the work order, then enter the page number in the :guilabel:`Worksheet
Page` field that appears below.

Select :guilabel:`Custom` if the document should be included in the :guilabel:`Instructions` tab at
the bottom of the |QCP|.

In the :guilabel:`Instructions` tab at the bottom of the form, enter instructions for how to
complete the quality checks created by the |QCP|.

If the :guilabel:`Custom` option was selected in the :guilabel:`Step Document` field above, a
document can be attached in this tab. To do so, either select the :guilabel:`Upload your file`
button to open the device's file manager, and then select a file, or add a link to a Google Slides
document in the :guilabel:`Google Slide Link` field.

In the :guilabel:`Message If Failure` tab, include instructions for what to do if the quality check

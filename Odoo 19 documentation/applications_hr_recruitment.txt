Recruitment
===========

Odoo keeps all job applicants organized with a preconfigured series of steps and stages that each
applicant goes through. Each stage has a specific steps that should be performed. These range from
scheduling a phone call, conducting an interview, or sending a job offer, for example. This process
is referred to as the *applicant flow.*

When an applicant applies for a job position, an *applicant card* is automatically created in Odoo's
**Recruitment** app for that specific job position. As the applicant progresses through the
recruitment pipeline, the recruitment team moves their card from one stage to the next.

:ref:`Stages can be configured <recruitment/modify-stages>` so that an email is automatically sent
out using a set, preconfigured template as soon as an applicant's card enters a stage. These
automated emails are defined on each stage in the applicant flow.

The flow described in this document is Odoo's default configuration, but it can be customized to
suit any recruitment process.

.. note::
   Stages apply to all job positions unless :ref:`marked as job-specific
   <recruitment/customize-stages>`  Changes to stages (e.g., additions, deletions) affect all
   positions unless explicitly scoped.

.. _recruitment/settings:

Settings
========

Before creating a job position in Odoo, configure the necessary settings for the **Recruitment**
app. To view and edit the settings, navigate to :menuselection:`Recruitment app --> Configuration
--> Settings`. After any changes are made, click the :guilabel:`Save` button in the top-left corner
to save all the changes.

Process
-------

The :guilabel:`Process` section of the settings page specifies what the database can and cannot do
during the recruitment process.

Send interview survey
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Odoo is capable of having a survey sent to an applicant to gather more information about them.
Surveys can be thought of as exams, or questionnaires, and can be customized in various ways to
provide the recruitment team with valuable insights into the applicant

Enable the :guilabel:`Send Interview Survey` option to send surveys to applicants. Once enabled, an
:icon:`fa-arrow-right` :guilabel:`Interview Survey` internal link appears. Click the
:icon:`fa-arrow-right` :guilabel:`Interview Survey` link to navigate to a list of all created
surveys.

This list includes all surveys that were created in the database, not only surveys used in the
**Recruitment** app. If no surveys have been created, the surveys list displays a :guilabel:`No
Survey Found` message, and presents options to create a survey from several preconfigured survey
templates.

.. seealso::
   :doc:`create/edit surveys <../marketing/surveys/create>`

.. note::
   Enabling the :guilabel:`Send Interview Survey` option will install the **Surveys** application
   once the settings are saved, if not already installed.

Salary package configurator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When sending an offer to an applicant, an expiration date can be set on the offer. Enter the number
of days an offer is valid for in the :guilabel:`days` field. After the set amount of days has
passed, if the applicant has not accepted the offer, the offer is no longer available.

.. _recruitment/cv-display:

Résumé display
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When applicants submit an application, one of the default required fields is a résumé, or :abbr:`CV
(curriculum vitae)`. All résumés are stored in the **Documents** application, and are accessible on
the applicant's card.

A résumé has the option to appear on the applicant's form, which can be viewed by clicking on the
applicant's card. The résumé appears on the right-side of the screen. If this is not enabled, the
résumé is accessed via a link in the chatter, where it needs to be clicked to expand and view it, or
downloaded.

Enable the :guilabel:`Résumé Display` option to show the résumé on the applicant's card by default,
and in addition to the document link. When enabled, the résumé appears on the right side of the
applicant's card.

.. note::
   For the résumé to appear on the right-side, the browser window must be in full-screen mode (where
   the browser spans the entire screen).

   If the browser window is set to a size smaller than the entire width of the screen (not
   full-screen), then the résumé does not appear on the right-side. Instead, the résumé appears in
   the :guilabel:`Files` section of the chatter, below the applicant's card.

.. image:: recruitment/cv-display.png
   :alt: The résumé on an applicant's card, appearing on the right side.

In-App Purchases
----------------

The :guilabel:`In-App Purchases` section of the :guilabel:`Settings` menu deals with items that
required credits to use, such as :abbr:`SMS (Short Message Service)` text messages, and digitizing
résumés.

.. seealso::
   :doc:`SMS pricing and FAQs <../marketing/sms_marketing/pricing_and_faq>`

Send SMS
~~~~~~~~

It is possible to send text messages to applicants directly through the **Recruitment** app. This
feature requires credits to use. Click the :icon:`fa-arrow-right` :guilabel:`Manage Service & Buy
Credits` internal link, and follow the steps to :doc:`purchase credits
<../marketing/sms_marketing/pricing_and_faq>`.

.. _recruitment/cv-ocr:

Résumé digitization (OCR)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When an application is submitted using any of the available methods, such as an online application
submission, emailing a resume to the job position alias, or creating an applicant record directly
from the database, it is possible to have Odoo extract the applicant's name, phone number, and email
address from the résumé and populate the applicant's form. To do so, enable the :guilabel:`Résumé
Digitization (OCR)` option.

When enabled, additional options appear. Click on the corresponding radio button to select one of
the following options:

- :guilabel:`Do not digitize`: this option turns off résumé digitization.
- :guilabel:`Digitize on demand only`: this option only digitizes resumes when requested. A
  :guilabel:`Digitize document` buttons appears on applicant cards. When clicked, the résumé is
  scanned and the applicant's card is updated.
- :guilabel:`Digitize automatically`: this option automatically digitizes all résumés when they are
  submitted.

Beneath these options are two additional links. Click the :icon:`fa-arrow-right` :guilabel:`Manage
Service & Buy Credits` internal link to purchase credits for résumé digitization. Click the
:icon:`fa-arrow-right` :guilabel:`View My Services` internal link to view a list of all current
services, and their remaining credit balances.

For more information on document digitization and :abbr:`IAP's (in-app purchases)`, refer to the
:doc:`In-app purchase (IAP) <../essentials/in_app_purchase>` documentation.

.. note::
   The :guilabel:`Do not digitize` option may appear redundant but serves a distinct purpose.
   Disabling the :guilabel:`Résumé Digitization (OCR)` option uninstalls the module, while
   :guilabel:`Do not digitize` keeps the module installed but inactive—allowing the user to
   re-enable digitization later without reinstalling the module.

Kanban view
===========

To access the Kanban view for a job position, navigate to the main :menuselection:`Recruitment` app
dashboard, which is the default view when opening the application. All job positions appear on the
main dashboard. Click the :guilabel:`(#) New Applications` smart button on a job position card to
navigate to the Kanban view for all the applicants for that particular job position.

.. image:: recruitment/new-applicants-button.png
   :alt: Main dashboard view of job position card, showing new applications button.

Inside the job application, the Kanban stages appear, with all the applicants populated in their
respective columns, indicating what stage they are currently in. In Odoo, six default stages are
configured:

- :ref:`New <recruitment/new>`
- :ref:`Initial Qualification <recruitment/initial-qualification>`
- :ref:`First Interview <recruitment/first-interview>`
- :ref:`Second Interview <recruitment/second-interview>`
- :doc:`Contract Proposal <recruitment/offer_job_positions>`
- :ref:`Contract Signed <recruitment/offer_job_positions/contract-signed>`

The last column, :guilabel:`Contract Signed`, is folded by default. Folded columns appear gray, and
the applicants in it are hidden from view. To expand the folded stage and view the applicant cards
for that column, click anywhere on the thin gray column that says the stage name and the column
expands, revealing the applicants.

.. image:: recruitment/stages.png
   :alt: Expand a folded column by clicking on it in the Kanban view.

Each stage has a color-coded bar beneath the stage name, providing status information for the
applicant's in that specific stage. The status colors are:

- :guilabel:`Green`: the applicant is ready to move to the next stage.
- :guilabel:`Red`: the applicant is blocked from moving to the next stage.
- :guilabel:`Gray`: the applicant is still in progress in the current stage and is neither ready nor
  blocked from the next stage.

The status for each card is set manually. To set the status, click on the small circle in the
lower-left of the applicant card. A status pop-up window appears. Click on the desired status for
the applicant. The status dot on the applicant card as well as the status bar updates.

.. image:: recruitment/status-dots.png
   :alt: The applicant card statuses, and status bar.

.. tip::
   The names for the three status colors (`In Progress`, `Ready for Next Stage`, and `Blocked`)
   :ref:`can be modified <recruitment/modify-stages>`, if desired.

.. _recruitment/customize-stages:

Customize stages
================

Stages can be modified, added, or deleted to match the particular hiring steps of a business.

New stage
---------

To create a new stage, click on :icon:`fa-plus` :guilabel:`Stage` and a new column appears. Enter
the title for the new stage in the :guilabel:`Stage title` field, then click :guilabel:`Add`. The
new column appears, and another new stage is available to create. If no new stages are needed, click
anywhere on the screen to exit the new stage creation.

   :alt: The gear icon that appears when a column name is moused over, and the drop-down menu it
         displays when clicked.

.. _recruitment/edit-stage:

Edit stage form
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :guilabel:`Edit: (Stage)` form is where the stage's settings are configured. The only required
field is the :guilabel:`Stage Name`.

The fields to be populated or modified are:

- :guilabel:`Stage Name`: Type in a name for the stage.
- :guilabel:`Email Template`: Select an email template to be used from the drop-down menu. If a
  template is selected, when the applicant card enters the stage, an email is automatically sent to
  the applicant using the selected template.
- :guilabel:`Folded in Kanban`: Check the box to have the stage appear folded (hidden) at all times
  in the default view.
- :guilabel:`Hired Stage`: Check the box if this stage indicates that the applicant is hired. When
  an applicant's card enters this stage, the card displays a :guilabel:`Hired` banner in the upper
  right corner. If this box is checked, this stage is used to determine the hire date of an
  applicant.
- :guilabel:`Job Specific`: If the stage only applies to specific job positions, select the job
  positions from the drop-down menu. Multiple job positions can be selected.
- :guilabel:`Show in Referrals`: Check the box if this stage should be seen in the *Referrals*
  application, and allow the referrer to accrue points when a referral of theirs reaches this stage.
  If this is active, a :guilabel:`Points` field appears. Enter the amount of referral points the
  employee receives when an applicant enters this stage. The **Referrals** app must be installed in
  order to use this option.
- :guilabel:`Points`: If :guilabel:`Show in Referrals` is enabled, this field appears. Enter the
  number of points the employee earns when an applicant moves to this stage.
- :guilabel:`Tooltips` section: There are three preconfigured status labels (colored circles) for
  each applicant's card, indicating its status. These colors are displayed at the top of each stage
  to reflect the statuses of the applicants in the stage. The *names* for the label can be modified,
  but the label itself (the color) cannot. The default names and labels are: :guilabel:`In Progress`
  (gray), :guilabel:`Blocked` (red), and :guilabel:`Ready for Next Stage` (green).
- :guilabel:`Requirements`: Enter any internal notes for this stage explaining any requirements of
  the stage.

Delete stage
------------

If a stage is no longer needed, the stage can be deleted. To delete a stage, hover over the name of
the stage, and a :icon:`fa-cog` :guilabel:`(Settings)` icon appears. First, click on the
:icon:`fa-cog` :guilabel:`(Settings)` icon to reveal a drop-down menu, then click :guilabel:`Delete`.
A :guilabel:`Confirmation` pop-up warning appears, asking :guilabel:`Are you sure you want to delete
this column?` Click :guilabel:`Delete` to delete the column.

.. important::
   If there are applicants currently in the stage being deleted, an error pops up when attempting to
   delete the stage. The records currently in the stage to need to be either deleted, archived, or
   moved to a different stage before the stage can be deleted.

Email templates
===============

To communicate with the applicant, Odoo has several preconfigured email templates that can be used.
The preconfigured email templates and when to use them are as follows:

- :guilabel:`Recruitment: Applicant Acknowledgement`: this template is used to let the applicant
  know that their application was received. This email is automatically sent out once the applicant
  is in the :guilabel:`New` stage.
- :guilabel:`Recruitment: Interest`: this template is used to let the applicant know that their
  application caught the recruiter's attention, and they have been shortlisted for either a phone
  call or an interview.
- :guilabel:`Recruitment: Not interested anymore`: this template is used when an applicant
  communicates that they are no longer interested in the position, and thanks them for their time
  and consideration.
- :guilabel:`Recruitment: Refuse`: this template is used when an applicant is no longer being
  considered for the position.
- :guilabel:`Recruitment: Schedule Interview`: this template is used to let the applicant know that
  they have passed the :guilabel:`Initial Qualification` stage, and they will soon be contacted to
  set up an interview with the recruiter. This email is automatically sent out once the applicant is
  in the :guilabel:`Initial Qualification` stage.

.. note::
   Email templates can be created, modified, and deleted to suit the needs of a business. For more
   information on email templates, refer to the :doc:`../general/companies/email_template` document.

To manually send an email, click :guilabel:`Send message` in the chatter. A text box appears, as
well as the applicant's email address.

   :alt: Send an email from the chatter.

Click the :icon:`fa-expand` :guilabel:`(Full composer)` icon in the bottom right corner of the
:guilabel:`Send Message` tab in the chatter. A :guilabel:`Compose Email` pop-up window loads, with
the :guilabel:`To` and :guilabel:`Subject` pre-populated. The applicant's email address is entered
in the :guilabel:`To` field, and the :guilabel:`Subject` is `(Job Position)`. The email body is
empty by default.

To use a preconfigured email template, click the :icon:`fa-ellipsis-v` :guilabel:`(vertical
elipsis)` button in the bottom of the window. Select the email template to use from the drop-down
menu.

Preconfigured email templates may contain dynamic placeholders so unique information can be
populated in the email for a more personalized message to the applicant. Several preconfigured email
templates are available to choose from. Depending on the template selected, the email subject or
body may change.

.. note::
   Only the email templates that are configured for the model load. Other email templates come
   preconfigured in Odoo, but if they are not configured for the recruitment application, they do
   not appear in the list of available templates.

If any attachments need to be added, click the :icon:`fa-paperclip` :guilabel:`(paperclip)` button
at the bottom of the window. Navigate to the file to be attached, then click :guilabel:`Open` to
attach it. To delete an attachment, click the :icon:`fa-close` :guilabel:`(delete)` icon to the
right of the attachment.

If any changes need to be made to the email, edit the body of the email. If the edits should be
saved to be used in the future, the email can be saved as a new template. Click the
:icon:`fa-ellipsis-v` :guilabel:`(vertical elipsis)` button in the bottom of the window, and select
:guilabel:`Save as Template`. Options are presented to either overwrite an existing template, or
save a new template. Click on an existing template name to overwrite that template, or click
:guilabel:`Save as Template` to save a new template. A :guilabel:`Create a Mail Template` pop-up
window loads. Enter a name for the template in the :guilabel:`Template Name` field, then click
:guilabel:`Save`.

To send the email, click :guilabel:`Send` and the email is sent to the applicant. The email then
appears in the chatter.

==================
Add new applicants
==================

Once an applicant submits an application, either using the online application, or emailing a job
position alias, an applicant card is automatically created in the **Recruitment** application.

However, in some instances, applicants may need to be created manually in the database. This could
be necessary if, for example, a company accepts paper applications in the mail, or is meeting
prospective applicants at an in-person job fair.

To view current applicants, navigate to the :menuselection:`Recruitment` app, then click the desired
job position card. Doing so reveals the :guilabel:`Applications` page, which displays all applicants
for that specific role, in a default Kanban view, organized by stage.

Add new applicants from a job position's :guilabel:`Applications` page by using either: the
:ref:`quick add <recruitment/quick-add-applicant>` button, or the :ref:`New
<recruitment/create-new-applicant>` button.

.. _recruitment/quick-add-applicant:

Quick add
=========

On the :guilabel:`Applications` page, click the quick add button, represented by a small
:icon:`fa-plus` :guilabel:`(plus)` icon in the top-right corner of each stage, to add a new
applicant to that stage.

Enter the following information on the card:

- :guilabel:`Candidate`: Select the applicant from the drop-down menu. Displays as the card title in
  the Kanban view of the :guilabel:`Applications` page. If the candidate is *not* in the system
  (from a previous application, or is a current employee), after entering the applicant's name,
  click :guilabel:`Create "(candidate)"`.
- :guilabel:`Job Position`: The current job position populates this field. If needed, the job
  position can be changed by selecting a different position from the drop-down menu. If a different
  job position is selected, after the card is created, the card appears on the
  :guilabel:`Applications` page for that newly-selected job position.

After the information is entered, click :guilabel:`Add`. The applicant appears in the list, and a
new blank applicant card appears.

If preferred, after entering the :guilabel:`Candidate` in the Kanban card that appears, click
:guilabel:`Edit`, and a detailed applicant form loads. Refer to the :ref:`New applicant form
<recruitment/applicant-details>` section for details about filling out the form.

When doing a quick add, clicking away from an empty card, or clicking the :icon:`fa-trash-o`
(:guilabel:`trash`) icon, discards the applicant.

.. image:: add-new-applicants/quick-add.png
   :alt: All the fields for a new applicant form entered when using the Quick Add option.

.. _recruitment/create-new-applicant:

New applicant form
==================

On the :guilabel:`Applications` page, click the :guilabel:`New` button in the top-left corner, and a

Applicant analysis
==================

The *Applicant Analysis* report allows recruiting departments to see which job positions have the
most applicants, which have the most referrals, and how long it takes for applicants to move through
the pipeline.

Knowing how many applicants each specific job position has, along with statistics about how many are
hired and refused, can provide valuable insights. This information can assist the recruiting team to
pivot their strategies to acquire the most desirable candidates.

Applicant analysis report
=========================

Start by navigating to :menuselection:`Recruitment app --> Reporting --> Applicant Analysis`. This
presents a line chart of all applicants for the last year.

Three separate color-coded metrics are presented: :guilabel:`In Progress`, :guilabel:`Hired`, and
:guilabel:`Refused`.

Hover the cursor over a month of the chart, and a pop-up window appears, displaying the specific
numbers for that month.

.. image:: applicant_analysis/line-chart.png
   :alt: The default Applicant Analysis report.

Pivot table view
----------------

For a more detailed view of the information in the :guilabel:`Applicant Analysis` report, click the
:icon:`oi-view-pivot` :guilabel:`(Pivot)` icon in the top-right corner. This displays all the
information in a pivot table.

In this view, the job positions are displayed in the rows, and the columns display the total numbers
of applicants, including how many of those applicants were hired or refused, and who is still in the
recruitment process. The displayed information can be modified, if desired.

In this example, there are 18 total applicants. Out of that, six have been hired, two have been
refused, and ten are still in the recruitment pipeline. The :guilabel:`Experienced Developer`
position has six total applicants, three of which were hired, one refused, and two still in
progress.

is, the :guilabel:`Applicant Analysis` report can be modified to show how many applicants were
referred by current employees.

From the :icon:`oi-view-pivot` :guilabel:`(Pivot)` view of the :guilabel:`Applicant Analysis`
report, first click the :guilabel:`Measures` button to reveal a drop-down menu of options.

Click both :guilabel:`Has Referrer` and :guilabel:`Count`, to activate those two measures. Then,
click :guilabel:`Applicant`, :guilabel:`Hired`, :guilabel:`In Progress` and :guilabel:`Refused` to
deactivate those default measures.

Now, the column displays the number of applicants that came from a referral in the :guilabel:`Has
Referrer` column, and the total number of applicants in the :guilabel:`Count` column.

.. image:: applicant_analysis/referral.png
   :alt: The detailed pivot table view displaying the number of referrals and the total applicants.

In this example, the :guilabel:`Experienced Developer` and :guilabel:`Interior Designer` job
positions both have applicants from referrals, while the rest do not have any referrals.

Hired through referrals
***********************

It is possible to modify this report even further to see how many referred applicants end up being
hired.

To view this data, click on a :icon:`fa-plus-square` :guilabel:`[job position]` row, which reveals a
drop-down menu. Then, click :guilabel:`State` to show the various states applicants are currently
in.

.. note::
   Only states that have applicants in them are shown for each job position. If a state does **not**
   have any applicants, it does not appear in the list.

To expand the other rows, and display the various states, click on the :icon:`fa-plus-square`
:guilabel:`[job position]` button.

.. image:: applicant_analysis/state.png
   :alt: The detailed pivot table view displaying applicants hired through referrals.

Both the :guilabel:`Experienced Developer` and :guilabel:`Interior Designer` roles yielded one
referral hire each, confirming that developers and designers generate the highest-success referrals.

.. _recruitment/interview:

Create interview form
---------------------

An *Interview Form* is used to determine if a candidate is a good fit for a job position. Interview
forms can be as specific or general as desired, and can take the form of a certification, an exam,
or a general questionnaire. Interview forms are determined by the recruitment team.

Before creating an interview form, ensure the proper settings are enabled. Navigate to
:menuselection:`Recruitment app --> Configuration --> Settings`, and under the
:guilabel:`Recruitment Process` section, ensure the :guilabel:`Send Interview Survey` option is
enabled.

Since there are no preconfigured forms in Odoo, all interview forms must be created. To create an
interview form, start from the :guilabel:`Recruitment` tab of the :guilabel:`Job Position` form. In
the :guilabel:`Interview Form` field, enter a name for the new interview form. As the name is typed,
several options populate beneath the entry: :guilabel:`Create (interview form name)`,
:guilabel:`Search More...`, and :guilabel:`Create and edit...`. Click :guilabel:`Create and edit...`
and a :guilabel:`Create Interview Form` pop-up window appears.

.. image:: new_job/blank-interview-form.png
   :alt: The blank interview form pop-up window.

.. note::
   The option :guilabel:`Search More...` only appears if there are any interview forms already
   created. If no interview forms exist, the only options available are :guilabel:`Create (interview
   form name)`, and :guilabel:`Create and edit...`.

Proceed to fill out the interview form pop-up window as a typical survey. For specific directions on
how to create a survey, refer to the :doc:`survey essentials <../../marketing/surveys/create>`
document, which provides step-by-step instructions on how to create and configure a survey.

Job board emails
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When posting job positions on a job board, like Indeed or LinkedIn, the job board posts the job
position, and typically allows the website visitor to apply to the job directly from the job board.

When someone applies to a job directly from a job board, an email is sent to Odoo from a specific
email address, such as `jobs-listings@linkedin.com`. The email uses regular expression (regex)
rules, which are instructions to match text in the email, and map it to specific fields in Odoo.

When Odoo receives an email from the job board's corresponding email address, it runs the regex
rule, and pulls applicant information from the email, when creating an applicant record.

.. example::
   The regex rule for :guilabel:`LinkedIn` (emails received from: `jobs-listings@linkedin.com`) is
   :guilabel:`New application:.*from (.*)`. This rule tells Odoo to capture everything after the
   word `from` when creating the applicant record.

   An email subject of `New application: Job ID 123 from John Doe` will capture `John Doe` and
   create an applicant record for `John Doe`.

To view the currently configured job board emails, navigate to :menuselection:`Recruitment app -->
Configuration --> Emails`. Three emails come preconfigured in the database; for
:guilabel:`LinkedIn`, :guilabel:`Jobsdb`, and :guilabel:`Indeed`.

Create job board emails
***********************

To create a new job board email, navigate to :menuselection:`Recruitment app --> Configuration -->
Emails`. Click the :guilabel:`New` button, and a blank :guilabel:`Emails` form loads.

Enter the :guilabel:`Name` for the platform, such as `Glassdoor`, in the corresponding field. Next,
enter the email address the applications will come from, in the :guilabel:`Email` field. Last, enter
the :guilabel:`regex` rules in the corresponding field.

View job board listings
-----------------------

To view all the job positions that have been posted to a job board, navigate to
:menuselection:`Recruitment --> Applications --> Job Boards Posts`. This presents the :guilabel:`Job
Boards Posts` dashboard and all job board postings.

Each listing is displayed in an individual Kanban card, with the following information:

- :guilabel:`Job Board Icon`: the icon for the job board where the listing is posted.
- :guilabel:`Job Board Listing Title`: the job position title and job board name.
- :guilabel:`From`: the date the listing was published.
- :guilabel:`To`: the date the listing will be removed from the job board.
- :guilabel:`User Icon`: the icon of the user who posted the listing.

Click on any Kanban card to view the details for the specific job board listing.

Recruitment flow
================

When a prospective employee applies for a job in Odoo, there is a preconfigured process from the
:ref:`initial inquiry <recruitment/new>` to the :ref:`creating of a new employee
<recruitment/new-employee>` once hired. The following outlines the default recruitment process for
Odoo's **Recruitment** application.

.. important::
   The following is based on Odoo's default recruitment pipeline. Be advised that if
   :ref:`modifications are made <recruitment/customize-stages>` to the pipeline, the process
   differs.

.. _recruitment/new:

New
===

At the start of the process, all applicants appear in the :guilabel:`New` stage on the
:guilabel:`Applications` page, whether submitted online or if the applicant is :doc:`manually
entered by a recruiter <add-new-applicants>`.

The :guilabel:`Candidate`, :guilabel:`Email`, and :guilabel:`Phone` number on the applicant's card
are filled as soon as it is created. By default, these details are required for every job position.

.. note::
   If the website application form is modified, different fields may be populated, based on what
   information is required on the website.

Anything typed in the *Short Introduction* section appears in the applicant's chatter as an
:guilabel:`Other Information` note from :guilabel:`OdooBot`.

Resumé
------

If a resumé was attached to the online application, it appears in the :guilabel:`Files` section of
the chatter, and is also stored in the **Documents** application.

To find the recruitment documents, navigate to the main :menuselection:`Documents app` dashboard,
and click the :guilabel:`Recruitment` folder on the left-hand side. All recruitment documents are
stored within that folder.

If the :ref:`CV Display <recruitment/cv-display>` option was enabled in the :ref:`Settings
<recruitment/settings>` of the **Recruitment** app, the resumé appears on the applicant's card.

.. note::
   Depending on the browser zoom level, or size of the browser screen, the resumé may appear below
   the main applicant card information as a PDF link, or on the right side as an image.

Send interview
--------------

At any point in the hiring process, an interview can be sent to the applicant to obtain more
information. These interviews are custom-made, and can be formatted in a variety of ways.

The **Surveys** application is required to send interviews to an applicant, so it **must** be
installed.

Odoo uses the term *interview*, but these can be thought of as questionnaires, surveys, tests,
certifications, etc. Custom interviews can be formatted to suit each individual job position's
needs. For more information on creating and editing interviews, refer to the
:doc:`../../hr/recruitment/new_job` documentation.

.. example::
   A job position for a computer programmer could have an interview in the form of a programming
   quiz to determine the skill level of the applicant. A job position for a restaurant server could
   have a questionnaire inquiring about the applicant's availability, if the desired applicant needs
   to be available on weekend evenings.

To send an interview to an applicant, first click the applicant's card from the
:guilabel:`Applications` page, to view the detailed applicant information. At the top-left of the
applicant's card, click the :guilabel:`Send Interview` button.

If the applicant's card has an email address on file, a :guilabel:`Send an interview` pop-up window
appears, with the :guilabel:`Recipients`, :guilabel:`Subject`, and email body populated.

.. note::
   To send an email to an applicant, there **must** be an :guilabel:`Email` address on the
   applicant's card.

   If an email address is not entered on the applicant's card, when the :guilabel:`Send Interview`
   button is clicked, an :guilabel:`Edit: (Applicant's Name)` pop-up window appears, *on top of* the
   :guilabel:`Send an interview` pop-up window.

   Enter the email address in the :guilabel:`Email` field, then click :guilabel:`Save & Close`.

   Once the applicant's information is saved, the :guilabel:`Edit: (Applicant's Name)` pop-up window
   closes, and the :guilabel:`Send an interview` pop-up window remains.

Sometimes, preconfigured email templates in Odoo use dynamic placeholders, which are automatically
filled with specific data when the email is sent. For example, if a placeholder for the applicant's
name is used, it is replaced with the actual name of the applicant in the email. For more detailed
information on email templates, refer to the :doc:`../../general/companies/email_template`
documentation.

Add the email addresses of any additional recipients for the survey in the :guilabel:`Additional
emails` field, if more people should receive the email. If an email address is in the database as a
contact, add that contact in the :guilabel:`Recipients` field. If an email should be sent to someone
who is not in the database as a contact, and they should **not** be added as a contact, add their
email address in the :guilabel:`Additional emails` field.

If any attachments need to be added, click the :icon:`fa-paperclip` :guilabel:`Attachments` button,
and a file explorer window appears. Navigate to the desired file, and click :guilabel:`Open` to
attach it to the email. The attachment loads, and is listed above the :icon:`fa-paperclip`
:guilabel:`Attachments` button.

If the emailed interview must be completed by a specific date, enter that date in the
:guilabel:`Answer deadline` field, located in the lower-right area of the pop-up window.

To do so, click the empty field next to :guilabel:`Answer deadline`, and a calendar selector
appears. Use the :icon:`fa-chevron-left` :guilabel:`(left)` and :icon:`fa-chevron-right`
:guilabel:`(right)` arrows, on either side of the month, to navigate to the desired month. Then,
click on the desired day to select the date. Next, select the time the interview is due, in the two
fields at the bottom of the calendar selector.

The :guilabel:`Mail Template` field is pre-populated, based on the configuration for the interview.
A different template can be chosen from the drop-down menu, if desired. If a new template is
selected, the new email template loads in the email body.

To send the email with the interview link to the applicant, click :guilabel:`Send` at the bottom of
the email pop-up window.

         preconfigured template.

.. _recruitment/initial-qualification:

Initial qualification
=====================

If an applicant seems to be a good potential candidate, they are moved to the :guilabel:`Initial
Qualification` stage.

This stage exists to sort candidates that have potential, from those that do not meet the
requirements. No automatic actions, such as emails, are set for this stage. This stage informs the
recruitment team to potentially set up a phone call or an interview with the candidate.

.. note::
   In order to move an applicant's card from one stage to another, the applicant's card can either
   be dragged and dropped in the Kanban view of the :guilabel:`Applications` page to the desired
   stage, or the stage can be modified on the applicant's card.

   To change the stage on the applicant's card, first click the desired applicant's card from the
   :guilabel:`Applications` page. The current stage for the card is highlighted at the top on a
   status bar, above the card.

   Click the desired stage for the card, and the stage changes. A log note indicating the stage
   change appears in the chatter, as well.

  .. image:: recruitment-flow/stage-change.png
     :alt: Change the stage of an applicant by clicking on the desired stage at the top of the
           applicant's card.

.. _recruitment/first-interview:

First interview
===============

After an applicant has passed the :guilabel:`Initial Qualification` stage, they can be manually
moved to the :guilabel:`First Interview` stage on the :guilabel:`Applications` page, while in Kanban
view.

To move the applicant to the next stage, drag-and-drop the applicant's card to the :guilabel:`First
Interview` stage.

Alternatively, open the desired applicant's card from the :guilabel:`Applications` page, and click
the :guilabel:`First Interview` stage on the status bar at the top of the individual applicant's
card.

.. tip::
   The :guilabel:`First Interview` stage can be modified, so when the applicant's card moves to the
   :guilabel:`First Interview` stage, an email can be automatically sent to the applicant, stating
   an interview is requested. In this preconfigured email template, a link to the recruiting team's
   calendar appears, allowing the applicant to schedule their interview.

   :ref:`Edit <recruitment/edit-stage>` the :guilabel:`First Interview` stage, and select the
   :guilabel:`Recruitment: Schedule Interview` option in the :guilabel:`Email Template` field, to
   automate this action.

.. _recruitment/second-interview:

Second interview
================

After an applicant has passed the :guilabel:`First Interview` stage, they can be moved to the
:guilabel:`Second Interview` stage. To move the applicant to the next stage, drag-and-drop the
applicant's card to the :guilabel:`Second Interview` stage from the Kanban view of the
:guilabel:`Applications` page, or click on the :guilabel:`Second Interview` stage at the top of the
individual applicant's card.

When the applicant's card moves to the :guilabel:`Second Interview` stage, there are no automatic
activities or emails configured for this stage, by default. The recruiter can now :ref:`schedule a
second interview <recruitment/schedule_interviews/recruitment-scheduled>` with the applicant,
following the same process as the first interview.

.. _recruitment/contract-proposal:

Contract Proposal
=================

After the applicant has completed the various interview processes, the next step is to :doc:`send
the job offer <offer_job_positions>`.

Once the offer has been sent, drag-and-drop the applicant's card to the :guilabel:`Contract
Proposal` stage from the Kanban view of the :guilabel:`Applications` page, or click on the
:guilabel:`Contract Proposal` stage at the top of the individual applicant's card.

Contract Signed
===============

Once the contract has been signed, and the applicant has been hired, the applicant's card moves to
the :guilabel:`Contract Signed` stage.

Drag-and-drop the applicant's card to the :guilabel:`Contract Signed` stage from the Kanban view of
the :guilabel:`Applications` page, or click the :icon:`fa-ellipsis-h` :guilabel:`(ellipsis)` icon at
the top of the individual applicant's card, then click :guilabel:`Contract Signed` on the status
bar.

Refuse applicant
================

At any point in the recruitment process, a candidate can be :doc:`refused <refuse_applicant>`.


==================================================
SECTION: refuse_applicant.rst
PATH: applications/hr/recruitment/refuse_applicant.rst
==================================================

=================
Refuse applicants
=================

At any point in the recruitment process, an applicant can be refused for a job position.

To refuse an applicant, start by navigating to the applicant's card in the **Recruitment** app. This
is done in one of two ways:

- Navigate to :menuselection:`Recruitment app --> Applications --> All Applications`. In the
  :guilabel:`Applications` list, click anywhere on the desired applicant's line to open that
  specific applicant's card.
- Navigate to the main *Job Positions* dashboard by navigating to :menuselection:`Recruitment app
  --> Applications --> By Job Position`. Next, click on the desired job position card, then click on
  the individual applicant card from the :guilabel:`Applications` page.

At the top of the applicant's card, there are several buttons. Click the one labeled
:guilabel:`Refuse`.

.. _recruitment/refuse-reasons:

Refuse reasons
==============

*Refuse reasons* allow recruiters to document why an applicant was not a good fit, and send specific
refusal reason email templates to the applicant.

Clicking :guilabel:`Refuse` on an applicant's form makes the :guilabel:`Refuse Reason` pop-up window
appear.

The default refuse reasons in Odoo, and their corresponding email templates, are:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Email Template
     - Refusal Reason
   * - :guilabel:`Recruitment: Refuse`
     - | :guilabel:`Does not fit the job requirements`
       | :guilabel:`Job already fulfilled`
       | :guilabel:`Duplicate`
       | :guilabel:`Spam`
   * - :guilabel:`Recruitment: Not interested anymore`
     - | :guilabel:`Refused by applicant: job fit`
       | :guilabel:`Refused by applicant: salary`

Additional refusal reasons :ref:`can be created, and existing ones can be modified (or deleted)
<recruitment/new-refuse>`.

Select a refusal reason to :ref:`send a refusal email <recruitment/send-refusal-email>`.

.. _recruitment/new-refuse:

Create or modify refuse reasons
-------------------------------

To view and configure refuse reasons, navigate to :menuselection:`Recruitment app --> Configuration
--> Refuse Reasons`. Doing so reveals the :guilabel:`Refuse Reasons` page, where all the existing
refusal reasons are listed.

To create a new refuse reason from the :guilabel:`Refuse Reasons` page, click the :guilabel:`New`
button in the top-left corner. A blank line appears at the bottom of the list, with an empty field
present in the :guilabel:`Description` column.

Type in the new refuse reason in the field. It is recommended to enter a reason that is short and
concise, such as `Offer expired` or `Withdrew application`.

Then, in the :guilabel:`Email Template` field, click on the field to reveal a drop-down menu. Select
an :guilabel:`Email Template` from the list to be used when this refuse reason is selected.

If a new :guilabel:`Email Template` is desired, type in the name for the new template in the field.
Then, click :guilabel:`Create and edit...`, and a :guilabel:`Create Email Template` form pop-up
window appears.

In the :guilabel:`Create Email Template` pop-up window, enter a :guilabel:`Name` for the form, and
an email :guilabel:`Subject` in the corresponding fields.

Enter the desired email content in the :guilabel:`Content` tab. Proceed to make any other
modifications to the template in the :guilabel:`Email Configuration` and :guilabel:`Settings` tabs,
then click :guilabel:`Save & Close` to save the template. Upon clicking that, Odoo returns to the
:guilabel:`Refuse Reasons` list.

The new template appears in the new refuse reason :guilabel:`Email Template` field.

.. note::
   Pre-configured recruitment refusal email templates in Odoo use dynamic placeholders, which are
   personalized placeholders that populate data from the applicant's record in the email body.

   For example, if the applicant's name is a used in a dynamic placeholder, the applicant's name
   appears anytime that dynamic placeholder appears on the email template.

   For more detailed information on email templates, refer to the
   :doc:`../../general/companies/email_template` documentation.

.. _recruitment/send-refusal-email:

Send refusal email
==================

After clicking the :guilabel:`Refuse` button on an applicant form, a :ref:`Refuse Reason
<recruitment/refuse-reasons>` is then selected from the :guilabel:`Refuse Reason` pop-up window.
Then, two fields appear below the selected refusal reason: :guilabel:`Send Email` and
:guilabel:`Email Template`.

.. image:: refuse_applicant/refuse-pop-up.png
   :alt: The Refuse Reason pop-up window that appears when refusing an applicant.

The applicant's email address automatically populates the :guilabel:`Send Email` field; additional
email recipients **cannot** be added.

If an email should **not** be sent to the applicant, uncheck the :guilabel:`Send Email` checkbox.

The email template associated with the refusal reason populates the :guilabel:`Email Template`
field. If a different email template is desired, select a different template from the
:guilabel:`Email Template` drop-down menu.

To send the refusal email to the applicant, ensure the :guilabel:`Send Email` checkbox is ticked,
then click :guilabel:`Refuse` at the bottom of the :guilabel:`Refuse Reason` pop-up window. The
refusal email is sent to the applicant, and a red :guilabel:`Refused` banner appears on the
applicant's card in the top-right corner.

.. image:: refuse_applicant/refuse.png
   :alt: An applicant's card with the refused banner appearing in the top-right corner in red.

View refused applicants
=======================

After refusal, the applicant's card is no longer visible in the job position's Kanban view. However,
it is still possible to view applicants who have been refused.

To view only the refused applicants, go to :menuselection:`Recruitment app --> Applications --> By
Job Positions`, or :menuselection:`Recruitment app --> Applications --> All Applications`. Both
methods navigate to the :guilabel:`Applications` dashboard, the only difference is :guilabel:`By Job
Positions` displays applicants in a Kanban view, while :guilabel:`All Applications` displays
applicants in a list view.

On the :guilabel:`Applications` page, click the :icon:`fa-caret-down` :guilabel:`(Toggle Search
Panel)` button in the search bar, then click :guilabel:`Refused`, located under the
:icon:`fa-funnel` :guilabel:`Filters` section.

All applicants that have been refused for the job position appear on the :guilabel:`Applications`
page for that position, organized by the stage they were in when they were refused.

Schedule interviews
===================

An in-person, virtual, or phone interview can be scheduled in one of two ways through the
**Recruitment** app, either by the :ref:`recruitment team
<recruitment/schedule_interviews/recruitment-scheduled>`, or by the :ref:`applicant
<recruitment/schedule_interviews/applicant-scheduled>`.

With one drag-and-drop, Odoo emails the candidate with a self-service link, the candidate books the
time slot, and sends the meeting to everyone's calendar. No more back-and-forth emails or calls.

.. _recruitment/schedule_interviews/recruitment-scheduled:

Recruitment team scheduled interviews
=====================================

When an applicant reaches the interview stage, the recruitment team should schedule the interview,
by first coordinating a suitable date and time with the applicant and interviewers.

To schedule the interview, navigate to the applicant's card, by first going to the
:menuselection:`Recruitment app`, and clicking the relevant job card. This opens the
:guilabel:`Applications` page for that job position. Then, click the desired applicant's card to
view their detailed applicant form.

To schedule an phone, virtual, or in-person interview, click the :icon:`fa-calendar` :guilabel:`No
Meeting` smart button at the top of the applicant's record.

.. note::
   The :guilabel:`Meetings` smart button displays :icon:`fa-calendar` :guilabel:`No Meeting` if no
   meetings are currently scheduled. For applicants who are new to the :guilabel:`First Interview`
   stage, this is the default.

   If there is one meeting already scheduled, the smart button displays :guilabel:`1 Meeting`, with
   the date of the upcoming meeting beneath it. If more than one meeting is scheduled, the button
   displays :guilabel:`Next Meeting`, with the date of the first upcoming meeting beneath it.

Clicking the :guilabel:`Meetings` smart button loads a calendar, showing the scheduled meetings and
events for the currently signed-in user, as well as the employees who are listed under the
:guilabel:`Attendees` section, located to the right of the calendar.

To change the currently loaded meetings and events being displayed, uncheck an attendee whose
calendar events are to be hidden. Only the checked attendees are visible on the calendar.

.. image:: schedule_interviews/calendar.png
   :alt: The calendar view, highlighting how to change the displayed meetings.

To add a meeting to the calendar when in the *Day* or *Week* view, click on the start time of the
meeting and drag down to the end time. Doing so selects the date, time, and the length of the
meeting.

A meeting can also be added in this view by clicking on the desired day *and* time slot.

Both methods cause a :ref:`New Event <recruitment/schedule_interviews/event-card>` pop-up window to
appear.

.. _recruitment/schedule_interviews/event-card:

New event pop-up window
-----------------------

Clicking a grid, corresponding with the time and date, opens the :guilabel:`New Event` pop-up window
to schedule a meeting.

Enter the information on the form. The only required fields to enter are a title for the meeting,
along with the :guilabel:`Start` (and end date/time) fields.

Once the card details are entered, click :guilabel:`Save & Close` to save the changes and create the
interview.

After entering in a required name for the meeting, the fields available to modify on the
:guilabel:`New Event` card are as follows:

- :guilabel:`Meeting Title`: Enter the subject for the meeting. This should clearly indicate the
  purpose of the meeting. The default subject is the :guilabel:`Candidate` name entered on the
  applicant's card.
- :guilabel:`Start`: Configure the start and end date and times for the meeting. Clicking either of
  these fields opens a calendar pop-up window. Click on the desired date to select it, and then
  enter the time in the corresponding field. Click :icon:`fa-check` :guilabel:`Apply` to close the
  window.
- :guilabel:`All Day`: Tick the box to schedule an all-day interview. If this box is ticked, the
  :guilabel:`Start` field changes to :guilabel:`Start Date`.
- :guilabel:`Attendees`: Select the people who should attend the meeting. The default attendees are
  the prospective candidate, and the assigned recruiter for the job position. Add as many other
  people as desired.
- :guilabel:`Videocall URL`: If the meeting is virtual, or if there is a virtual option available,
  click :icon:`fa-plus` :guilabel:`Odoo meeting`, and a URL is automatically created for the
  meeting, which populates the field.
- :guilabel:`Description`: Enter a brief description in this field. There is an option to enter
  formatted text, such as numbered lists, headings, tables, links, photos, and more. Use the
  powerbox feature, by typing a `/` to reveal a list of options.

  Scroll through the options and click on the desired item. The item appears in the field, and can
  be modified. Each command presents a different pop-up window. Follow the instructions for each
  command to complete the entry.

More options
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add additional information to the meeting, click the :guilabel:`More Options` button in the
lower-right corner of the :ref:`New Event <recruitment/schedule_interviews/event-card>` pop-up
window. Enter any of the following additional fields:

- :guilabel:`Duration`: this field auto populates based on the :guilabel:`Start` (and end) date and
  time. If the meeting time is adjusted, this field automatically adjusts to the correct duration
  length. The default length of a meeting is one hour.
- :guilabel:`Recurrent`: if the meeting should repeat at a selected interval (not typical for a
  first interview), tick the checkbox next to :guilabel:`Recurrent`. Several additional fields
  appear when this is enabled:

  - :guilabel:`Timezone`: using the drop-down menu, select the :guilabel:`Timezone` for the
    recurrent meetings.
  - :guilabel:`Repeat`: choose :guilabel:`Daily`, :guilabel:`Weekly`, :guilabel:`Monthly`,
    :guilabel:`Yearly`, or :guilabel:`Custom` recurring meetings. If :guilabel:`Custom` is selected,
    a :guilabel:`Repeat Every` field appears beneath it, along with another time frequency parameter
    (:guilabel:`Days`, :guilabel:`Weeks`, :guilabel:`Months`, or :guilabel:`Years`). Enter a number
    in the blank field, then select the time period using the drop-down menu.
  - :guilabel:`Repeat on`: enabled when the :guilabel:`Weekly` option is selected in the
    :guilabel:`Repeat` field. Choose the day the weekly meeting falls on.
  - :guilabel:`Day of Month`: configure the two drop-down menu options to select a specific day of
    the month, irrespective of the date (e.g. the first Tuesday of every month). To set a specific
    calendar date, choose :guilabel:`Date of Month` and enter the calendar date in the field (e.g.
    `15` to set the meeting to occur on the fifteenth of every month).
  - :guilabel:`Until`: using the drop-down menu, select when the meetings stop repeating. The
    available options are :guilabel:`Number of repetitions`, :guilabel:`End date`, and
    :guilabel:`Forever`. If :guilabel:`Number of repetitions` is selected, enter the number of total
    meetings to occur in the blank field to the right. If :guilabel:`End date` is selected, specify
    the date using the calendar pop-up window, or type in a date in a MM/DD/YYYY format.
    :guilabel:`Forever` schedules meetings indefinitely.

- :guilabel:`Location`: enter the location for the meeting.
- :guilabel:`Tags`: select any tags for the meeting using the drop-down menu, or add a new tag by
  typing in the tag and clicking :guilabel:`Create "tag"`. There is no limit to the number of tags
  that can be used.
- :guilabel:`Privacy`: select if the organizer appears either :guilabel:`Available` or
  :guilabel:`Busy` for the duration of the meeting. Next, select the visibility of this meeting,
  using the drop-down menu to the right of the first selection. Options are :guilabel:`Public`,
  :guilabel:`Private`, and :guilabel:`Only internal users`. :guilabel:`Public` allows for everyone
  to see the meeting, :guilabel:`Private` allows only the attendees listed on the meeting to see the
  meeting, and :guilabel:`Only internal users` allows anyone logged into the company database to see
  the meeting.
- :guilabel:`Organizer`: the employee who created the meeting is populated in this field. Use the
  drop-down menu to change the selected employee.
- :guilabel:`Reminders`: select a reminder from the drop-down menu. Default options include
  :guilabel:`Notification`, :guilabel:`Email`, and :guilabel:`SMS Text Message`, each with a
  specific time period before the event (hours, days, etc). The chosen reminder chosen alerts the
  meeting participants of the meeting, via the selected option at the specified time. Multiple
  reminders can be selected in this field.

Send meeting to attendees
-------------------------

Once changes have been entered on the :ref:`New Event <recruitment/schedule_interviews/event-card>`
pop-up window, and the meeting details are correct, the meeting can be sent to the attendees, via
email or text message, from the expanded event form (what is seen when the :guilabel:`More Options`
button is clicked on in the :guilabel:`New Event` pop-up window).

To send the meeting via email, click the :icon:`fa-envelope` :guilabel:`EMAIL` button next to the
:guilabel:`Attendees` field on the expanded meeting form.

A :guilabel:`Contact Attendees` email configurator pop-up window appears. A pre-formatted email,
using the default :guilabel:`Calendar: Event Update` email template, populates the email body field.

The applicant, followers of the job application, as well as the user who created the meeting, are
added to the :guilabel:`To` by default. Make any desired changes to the email.

.. image:: schedule_interviews/email-event.png
   :alt: Enter the information to send the event via email.

To send the meeting via text message, click the :icon:`fa-mobile` :guilabel:`SMS` button next to the
:guilabel:`Attendees` field on the expanded meeting form. A :guilabel:`Send SMS` pop-up window
appears.

At the top, a blue banner appears if any attendees do not have valid mobile numbers, and lists how
many records are invalid. If a contact does not have a valid mobile number listed, click
:guilabel:`Close`, and edit the attendee's record, then redo these steps.

When no warning message appears, type in the message to be sent to the attendees in the
:guilabel:`Message` field. To add any emojis to the message, click the :icon:`oi-smile-add`
:guilabel:`(smile add)` icon on the right-side of the pop-up window.

The number of characters, and amount of text messages required to send the message (according to
GSM7 criteria) appears beneath the :guilabel:`Message` field. Click :guilabel:`Put in queue` to have
the text sent later, after any other messages are scheduled, or click :guilabel:`Send Now` to send
the message immediately.

.. note::
   Sending text messages is **not** a default capability with Odoo. To send text messages, credits
   are required, which need to be purchased. For more information on IAP credits and plans, refer to
   the :doc:`../../essentials/in_app_purchase` documentation.

.. _recruitment/schedule_interviews/applicant-scheduled:

Applicant scheduled interviews
==============================

Coordinating interview times typically requires several email exchanges and can slow the recruitment
process. Enabling Odoo's self-service scheduling removes that bottleneck: when an applicant is moved
to an interview stage, the system automatically sends a scheduling link, records the selected slot,
and updates all relevant calendars.

This automation is turned off by default. To activate it, assign the :guilabel:`Recruitment:
Schedule Interview` email template to either the :guilabel:`First Interview` or :guilabel:`Second
Interview` stage (see :ref:`recruitment/schedule_interviews/modify-stage`).

.. _recruitment/schedule_interviews/modify-stage:

Modify stage
------------

:ref:`Modify <recruitment/modify-stages>` either the :guilabel:`First Interview` or
:guilabel:`Second Interview` stage so the stage's :guilabel:`Email Template` field is set to
:guilabel:`Recruitment: Schedule interview`.

.. image:: schedule_interviews/interview-template.png
   :alt: The Recruitment: Schedule Interview email template populating the Email Template field.

Send email
----------

After configuring the :guilabel:`First Interview` or :guilabel:`Second Interview` stages to
:ref:`send emails <recruitment/schedule_interviews/modify-stage>`, drag-and-drop the applicant card
into one of these stages to send the email.

Self-scheduled interview
------------------------

When the applicant received the email, they click the :guilabel:`Schedule my interview` button at
the bottom of the email. This navigates the applicant to a private online scheduling page, which is
**only** accessible through the emailed link.

This page displays the :guilabel:`MEETING DETAILS` on the right side of the screen. This includes
the format and length of the meeting. In this example. the interview is virtual
(:icon:`fa-video-camera` :guilabel:`Online`) and the duration is a half hour (:icon:`fa-clock-o`
:guilabel:`30 minutes`).

Then the applicant clicks on an available day on the calendar, signified by purple text. Once a day
is selected, they click on one of the available times to select that date and time.

.. image:: schedule_interviews/select-date-time.png
   :alt: The calendar screen with dates and times to schedule an interview.

.. tip::
   Be sure to check the :guilabel:`Timezone` field, beneath the calendar, to ensure it is set to the
   correct time zone. Changing the time zone may alter the available times presented.

Once the date and time are selected, the applicant is navigated to an :guilabel:`Add more details
about you` page. This page asks the applicant to enter their :guilabel:`Full name`,
:guilabel:`Email`, and :guilabel:`Phone number`. The contact information entered on this form is how
the applicant is contacted to remind them about the scheduled interview.

When everything is entered on the :guilabel:`Add more details about you` page, the applicant clicks
the :guilabel:`Confirm Appointment` button, and the interview is scheduled.

.. image:: schedule_interviews/confirmation.png
   :alt: The confirmation page with all the details for the interview displayed.

After confirming the interview, the applicant is taken to a confirmation page, where all the details
of the interview are displayed. The option to add the meeting to the applicant's personal calendars
is available, through the :guilabel:`Add to iCal/Outlook` and :guilabel:`Add to Google Agenda`
buttons, beneath the interview details.

The applicant is also able to cancel or reschedule the interview, if necessary, with the
:guilabel:`Cancel your appointment` link at the bottom of the confirmation.

Source analysis reporting
=========================

Reporting is a critical tool used by recruiting departments to gain insights into the entire
recruitment process.

Determining where applicants come from can provide information about which sources have the best
results. This information is determined by the *Source Analysis* report. With this data, recruitment
teams can better pivot their recruiting strategies to gain better applicants, in both quantity and
quality.

Open report
===========

To access the *Source Analysis* report, navigate to :menuselection:`Recruitment app --> Reporting
--> Source Analysis`.

This presents the data for the :icon:`fa-filter` :guilabel:`Last 365 Days Applicant`, in a default
:icon:`fa-area-chart` :guilabel:`(Graph)` view, showing the amount of applicants by
:guilabel:`Source`, and further separated by stage (:guilabel:`In Progress` and :guilabel:`Hired`)

Hover the cursor over any column to view the specific numbers fort that column.

.. image:: source_analysis/source-analysis.png
   :alt: The default bar chart of the source analysis information.

Source effectiveness report
===========================

To identify which sources (e.g., job boards, social media, employee referrals, company website)
produce the most hires, the pivot table view of the :guilabel:`Source Analysis` report can be
configured to display further details.

To view the :guilabel:`Source Analysis` report in a pivot table, click the :icon:`oi-view-pivot`
:guilabel:`(Pivot)` icon in the top-right corner. The data is presented in a pivot table, with rows
populated by job positions, and columns populated by stages.

To expand this chart to show what specific sources the applicants came from, click the
:icon:`fa-plus-square` :guilabel:`Total` box above the columns, to reveal a drop-down menu, and
click :guilabel:`Source`.

Each column is then grouped by the source, such as: :guilabel:`Search engine`, :guilabel:`Facebook`,
:guilabel:`LinkedIn`, etc. Each source displays a separate count for :guilabel:`Applicant`,
:guilabel:`Hired`, and :guilabel:`Refused`.

This information, as presented, makes it difficult to view the specific numbers for each source.
Click the :icon:`fa-exchange` :guilabel:`(Flip axis)` icon, to swap the information. After that, the
rows represent the source, and the columns represent the job positions, further divided by stage.

   :alt: The axes flipped in the source analysis report, in pivot table view.

In this view, the total number of applicants, hired employees, and refused applicants, are displayed
for each source, as well as for each stage by job position.

Medium
------

Viewing the medium for the applicants can be beneficial to see which specific medium is more
successful.

*Mediums* are the specific methods the applicant used to discover and then apply for job positions,
such as organic search, paid search, social media ad, email, etc.

To further group the results by medium, click into one of the :icon:`fa-plus-square`
:guilabel:`[Source]` rows. Click :guilabel:`Medium` in the resulting drop-down menu. The row
presents the specific mediums, relevant to that specific source.

Once :guilabel:`Medium` is selected for one source, clicking into another row automatically reveals
the specific metrics for the mediums for that source.

.. image:: source_analysis/medium.png
   :alt: The sources rows, expanded to also show the medium for each source.

.. note::
   The only mediums that appear for a source, are mediums that have been set on an applicant's form.
   If a medium has **not** been set for any applicants, the medium does not appear in the drop-down
   rows beneath the source.

   For example, if no applicants applied with the medium *Google Adwords*, that medium does **not**
   appear beneath the *Search engine* source row.

Team performance
================

The *Team Performance* report in the **Recruitment** app shows how many applicants each recruiter is
managing.

This information is determined by the individuals populating the :ref:`Recruiter
<recruitment/applicant-details>` field on each applicant form.

Open report
===========

To access the *Team Performance* report, navigate to :menuselection:`Recruitment app --> Reporting
--> Team Performance`.

The number of :guilabel:`In Progress`, :guilabel:`Hired`, and :guilabel:`Refused` applicants for
each recruiter is displayed in a default :icon:`fa-area-chart` :guilabel:`(Graph)` view.

The information shown is for the :icon:`fa-filter` :guilabel:`Last 365 Days Applicant` default
filter, as displayed in the search bar.

Hover the cursor over any column to view a popover window, displaying the specific details for that
column.

Pivot table view
----------------

For a more detailed view of the information in the :guilabel:`Team Performance` report, click the
:icon:`oi-view-pivot` :guilabel:`(Pivot)` icon in the top-right corner. This displays all the
information in a pivot table.

In this view, the job positions populate the rows, while the columns populate the number of
applicants. The first column, :guilabel:`Applicant`, is the total number of applicants across all
stages for that job position. The subsequent columns display the total applicants that have been
:guilabel:`Hired`, :guilabel:`Refused`, and :guilabel:`In Progress` for each job position.

The displayed information can be modified, if desired.

In this example, there are 20 total applicants. Out of those 20, eight have been hired, five have
been refused, and seven are still in the recruitment process.

From the data presented, the :guilabel:`Experienced Developer` job position is the most successful.
This job position has one of the highest number of total applicants (tied with the
:guilabel:`Marketing and Community Manager` position), as well as the most hires.

This pivot table also shows that the :guilabel:`Quality Control Inspector` position is the hardest
to fill, as it has the fewest total applicants.

Use case: recruiter performance over time
=========================================

One way to modify this report is to show how recruiters are performing over time. To show this
information, begin with the :guilabel:`Team Performance` report in the :icon:`oi-view-pivot`
:guilabel:`(Pivot)` view.

Next, click the :icon:`fa-caret-down` :guilabel:`(down arrow)` in the search bar, revealing a
drop-down menu. Click :guilabel:`Add Custom Group` :icon:`fa-caret-down` at the bottom of the
:icon:`oi-group` :guilabel:`Group By` column, then click :guilabel:`Recruiter`. Click away from the
drop-down menu to close it. Now, each row on the table represents a recruiter.

.. image:: team_performance/by-recruiter.png
   :alt: The pivot table now displaying the recruiters in the rows.

To compare the team's performance over different time periods, click the :icon:`fa-caret-down`
:guilabel:`(down arrow)` in the search bar. Click :guilabel:`Application Date` :icon:`fa-caret-down`
in the :icon:`fa-filter` :guilabel:`Filters` column, revealing various time periods to select.

In this example, the desired data is the comparison between the team's performance in the third
quarter (June - August) and the second quarter (April - July). To do so, click :guilabel:`Q3`. Once
clicked, the current year is also ticked. In this example, it is :guilabel:`2025`.

After making this selection, a :icon:`fa-adjust` :guilabel:`Comparison` column appears. Click
:guilabel:`Start Date: Previous Period` to compare the third quarter with the second quarter, for
the various recruiters.

.. image:: team_performance/compare.png
   :alt: A comparison table of recruiter totals of Q2 and Q3.

From this report, some things can be extrapolated: the total number of applicants, the number of
hired applicants, the number of refused applicants, and the number of applicants still in the
recruitment pipeline all increased.

Additionally, :guilabel:`Maggie Davidsons` had the highest increase in number of hired applicants
during the third quarter, while their number of refused applicants went down.

Velocity analysis
=================

The *Velocity Analysis* report provides information on how long applicants stay in each stage of the
recruitment process. This is important, as every job position has specific :ref:`process details
<recruitment/new_job_position/edit>` that state the length of time applicants should expect to wait
between specific stages.

Knowing how long applicants remain in each stage can help highlight possible bottlenecks. Analyzing
this data allows the recruitment team to assess each stage, identify any issues, and pivot their
strategies to move applicants through each stage, within the expected time interval.

Velocity analysis report
========================

To access the report, navigate to :menuselection:`Recruitment app --> Reporting --> Velocity
Analysis`. By default, the report displays data for all job positions, with the stages populating
the x-axis, and the number of days populating the y-axis, in a :icon:`fa-line-chart`
:guilabel:`(Line Chart)`.

The default filter is :guilabel:`Last 365 Days Applicant`, showing information for the last 365
days.

Hover over a stage in the line chart to reveal a popover window listing all the job positions within
it, and the average number of days each job position sits in each stage.

For a more visually digestible view of the information in the :guilabel:`Velocity Analysis` report,
click the :icon:`fa-bar-chart` :guilabel:`(Bar Chart)` icon in the upper-left corner. This displays
all the information in a bar chart.

In this view, it is easier to visualize the differences between the job positions, regarding how
long applicants stay in each stage. From this view, recruiters can determine which job positions
have delays or bottlenecks at certain stages.

Use case: comparing times by month
----------------------------------

With the :guilabel:`Velocity Analysis` report, it is possible to see if there are certain months
where applicants take longer to be moved through the pipeline. To view this data, switch to the
:icon:`oi-view-pivot` :guilabel:`(Pivot)` view in the upper-right corner.

This presents the data in a detailed pivot table, with the rows representing the different job
positions, and the columns representing the stages. The average :guilabel:`Days in Stage` populates
the various boxes.

.. note::
   If a field is empty, it indicates no applicant has been in that stage. Instead, all applicants
   moved from a previous stage without being placed in the stage with an empty field.

.. image:: velocity_analysis/time-pivot.png
   :alt: The pivot table view of the Velocity Analysis report.

Click :icon:`fa-minus-square-o` :guilabel:`Total` above the job position rows to collapse the
information. Next, click :icon:`fa-plus-square` :guilabel:`Total` again, revealing a drop-down menu.
Click :guilabel:`Add Custom Group` :icon:`fa-caret-down` at the bottom of the list, revealing
further grouping options. Click :guilabel:`Start Date` from the expanded list.

After doing so, the data presented is grouped with the various months from the previous 365 days for
the rows, leaving the :guilabel:`Days In Stage` as the columns.

.. image:: velocity_analysis/time-dates.png
   :alt: The pivot table showing the months averages for times in stage.

In this example, :guilabel:`July 2024` had the longest time that applicants spent in each stage, on
average. In addition, the :guilabel:`Contract Proposal` stage had the longest wait time in July,
with an average of :guilabel:`31.62` days in that stage.

While this report does not display the reasons applicants stayed in the various stages for these
lengths of time, it can be helpful to know when delays occur.

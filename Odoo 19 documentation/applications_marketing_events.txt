Events dashboard
================

When the **Events** application is opened, Odoo reveals the main :guilabel:`Events` dashboard, which
can be viewed in a number of different ways. Those different view options are accessible from the
:guilabel:`Events` dashboard in the upper-right corner, via a series of view-related icon buttons.

By default, the :guilabel:`Events` dashboard is displayed in the :icon:`oi-view-kanban`
:guilabel:`Kanban` view, which is populated with a variety of pipeline stages.

.. image:: events/kanban-dashboard.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Overview of events setting with the kanban view in Odoo Events.

This view showcases all the events in the database in their respective stages. By default, the
stages are: :guilabel:`New`, :guilabel:`Booked`, :guilabel:`Announced`, :guilabel:`Ended`, and
:guilabel:`Cancelled`.

.. note::
   The :guilabel:`Ended` and :guilabel:`Cancelled` stages are folded, by default, and located to the
   right of the other stages.

On each event card, find the scheduled date of the event, the name of the event, the location, the
number of expected :guilabel:`Attendees`, any scheduled activities related to the event, the status
of the event, and the person responsible for the event.

To quickly add a new event to a pipeline, click the :icon:`fa-plus` :guilabel:`(plus)` icon at the
top of the stage to which the event should be added to reveal a blank Kanban card to fill out.

.. image:: events/blank-kanban-card.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Typical blank kanban card to fill out in the Odoo Events application.

In this blank Kanban card, enter the name of :guilabel:`Event`, along with the start and end
:guilabel:`Date` and time.

Then, either click :guilabel:`Add` to add it to the stage and edit it later, or click
:guilabel:`Edit` to add the event to stage and edit its configurations on a separate page.

Each event card can be dragged-and-dropped into any stage on the Kanban pipeline, providing easy
organizational access.

Settings
========

To access the event settings and feature options in Odoo **Events**, navigate to
:menuselection:`Events app --> Configuration --> Settings`. From here, tick the checkboxes beside
the desired settings and/or features, and click :guilabel:`Save` to activate them.

Events section
--------------

In the :guilabel:`Events` section of the :guilabel:`Settings` page, there are selectable features
that can be enabled to add various elements to events created with the Odoo **Events** application.

.. image:: events/settings-events-section.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The Events section on the Odoo Events settings page in the Odoo Events application.

The :guilabel:`Schedule & Tracks` feature allows users to manage and publish a schedule with tracks
for events. *Tracks* is a catch-all term that refers to talks, lectures, demonstrations,
presentations, and other similar elements that users may choose to include as part of an event.

When the :guilabel:`Schedule & Tracks` feature is enabled, two additional fields appear beneath it:
:guilabel:`Live Broadcast` and :guilabel:`Event Gamification`.

The :guilabel:`Live Broadcast` feature lets users air tracks online, via a *YouTube* integration.

The :guilabel:`Event Gamification` feature lets users share a quiz after any event track, in order
for attendees to gauge how much they learned from the track they just saw/heard. Companies can also
benefit from this feature, in that the subsequent responses and results of the quizzes can help
determine where a company's strengths and weaknesses are, when it comes to their presentations.

Next, is the :guilabel:`Online Exhibitors` feature. This feature allows users to display sponsors
and exhibitors on event pages, which can serve as a valuable incentive to encourage partners and
businesses to participate in the event.

The :guilabel:`Jitsi Server Domain` field represents an external conferencing service that is
integrated with Odoo. It is what is used to create and host virtual conferences, community rooms,
and other similar elements for events.

The :guilabel:`Community Chat Rooms` feature allows users to create virtual conference rooms for
event attendees, providing them with a centralized place to meet and discuss anything related to the
event.

Lastly, there is the :guilabel:`Booth Management` feature. This feature provides users with the
ability to create and manage event booths and booth reservations. When enabled, users can create
different booth tiers, with individual price points, and sell them to interested parties.

Registration section
--------------------

The :guilabel:`Registration` section of the :guilabel:`Settings` page provides selectable settings
that are directly related to event registration.

.. image:: events/settings-registration-section.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The Registration section in the Odoo Events settings page in the Odoo Events application.

The :guilabel:`Tickets` setting allows users to sell event tickets, via standard sales orders.

The :guilabel:`Online Ticketing` setting creates a selectable *Event Ticket* product type on product
forms, which provides users with the ability to sell event tickets online, via their
website/eCommerce store.

Attendance section
------------------

In the :guilabel:`Attendance` section of the :guilabel:`Settings` page, there is a selectable
setting that is directly related to how attendees can attend/enter the event.

.. image:: events/settings-attendance-section.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The Attendance section in the Odoo Events Settings page in the Odoo Events application.

The :guilabel:`Use Event Barcode` setting, when activated, enables barcode (and QR code) scanning
for attendees to enter the event. This provides attendees with quick access, and helps Odoo users
easily track, manage, and analyze all event attendees.

The :guilabel:`Barcode Nomenclature` field, beneath the :guilabel:`Use Event Barcode` setting, is
set to :guilabel:`Default Nomenclature`, by default, but can be changed at any time.

Create events
=============

With Odoo **Events**, events can be manually created from scratch or built off of pre-made
templates.

Once launched, the **Events** application then integrates with the **Website** app for the front-end
promotion and registration of the event for attendees, the **Sales** app for the purchasing ability
of paid tickets, and the **CRM** application through customizable lead generation rules.

Create events
=============

With the *Events* application, event organizers can create and configure in-person or online-only
events in Odoo. Each new event contains a number of customizable options that are geared around
specific event logistics, as needed per event, such as ticket sales and registration desk, booths,
tracks, sponsors, rooms, and more.

Events can be manually created from scratch or built off of pre-made templates. Once launched, the
*Events* application then integrates with the *Website* app for the front-end promotion and
registration of the event for attendees, the *Sales* app for the purchasing ability of paid tickets,
as well the *CRM* application through customizable lead generation rules.

.. _events/new-event:

New event
=========

To create a new event, begin by navigating to the :menuselection:`Events app` to land on the default
:guilabel:`Events` dashboard, in the :icon:`oi-view-kanban` :guilabel:`Kanban` view. From there, or
alternatively from the :icon:`oi-view-list` :guilabel:`List` or :icon:`fa-tasks` :guilabel:`Gantt`
views, click the :guilabel:`New` button in the upper-left corner of the dashboard to open up a new
event form.

.. image:: create_events/blank-event-template.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Typical event template in the Odoo Events application.

.. note::
   If certain fields do not readily appear on the event form, that means an additional application
   needs to be installed, or the database is not operating in a multi-company environment.

   For example, the :guilabel:`Twitter Wall` field **only** appears if the *Social Marketing* app is
   installed, and the :guilabel:`Company` field **only** appears if the database is working in a
   multi-company environment.

   These are just *additional* elements that can be used for an event. They are **not** required to
   create, host, and manage an event with Odoo *Events*.

Event form
==========

At the top of the event form are a series of smart buttons related to various event metrics, which
will autopopulate with pertinent data once attendees begin to register, booths and sponsors sign on
for the event, the event takes place, and so on.

Primarily, these smart buttons are used as logistical portals to perform specific actions for the
event. The numeric displays are primarily for quick reference points.

While those visual metrics are useful, they can still be clicked, and used to navigate to
specific event-related pages to modify and/or perform any desired actions.

Beneath the smart buttons is the event form, which contains various fields and clickable tabs that
serve to configure the initial, necessary details of the event.

The following are fields found on an event form:

- :guilabel:`Event Name`: the title of the event. This field is **required**.

  .. note::
     To the right of the entered :guilabel:`Event Name`, there is a language tooltip, represented by
     an abbreviated language indicator (e.g. `EN`). When clicked, a :guilabel:`Translate: name`
     pop-up window appears, displaying various pre-configured language translation options available
     in the database.

- :guilabel:`Date`: when the event is scheduled to take place (expressed in your local timezone).
  This field is auto-populated, but modifiable, and is **required**.
- :guilabel:`Display Timezone`: the timezone in which the event dates/times will be displayed on the
  website. This field is auto-populated, but modifiable, and is **required**.
- :guilabel:`Language`: designate a specific language for all event communications to be translated
  into, if necessary. This field is blank, by default, so if event-related communications are being
  sent to recipients who speak a different language, be sure to configure this field properly.
- :guilabel:`Twitter Wall`: creates a separate page on the event website to feature specific social
  posts on X (formerly Twitter) that contain pre-determined desired elements.

  .. tip::
     To create and customize a :guilabel:`Twitter Wall`, type the name of the desired wall into the
     field, and select :guilabel:`Create and edit...` from the resulting drop-down menu.

     Doing so reveals :guilabel:`Create Twitter Wall` pop-up window.

     .. image:: create_events/twitter-wall-popup.png
        :align: center
        :alt: The Twitter Wall pop-up window in the Odoo Events application.

     From this window, enter a :guilabel:`Wall Name`. Then, select a certain word or hashtag for
     Odoo to search for on X, like `#WoodWorkingExpo24`, for example.

     Next, determine the :guilabel:`Type of tweets` Odoo should showcase with that predetermined
     criteria. The choices in this field are: :guilabel:`Recent`, :guilabel:`Popular`, or
     :guilabel:`Mixed`.

     Users also have the option to add a brief :guilabel:`Description` to the wall, as well.

     Lastly, the greyed-out, non-modifiable :guilabel:`Website URL` field will autopopulate with the
     full URL needed to access the document through the event website.

     An image can also be added to the wall by clicking the :icon:`fa-pencil` :guilabel:`(pencil)`
     icon that appears when the cursor hovers over the :guilabel:`(camera)` placeholder image in the
     upper-right corner of the pop-up window.

     Then, from the resulting file explorer window, select the desired image to be added to the
     wall.

     This :guilabel:`Twitter Wall` field **only** appears on the event form if the *Social
     Marketing* app is installed, and an X account has been added as a stream on the application. To
     learn more, check out the :doc:`Social Marketing <../social_marketing>` documentation.

- :guilabel:`Template`: choose a pre-configured event template from the resulting drop-down menu.

  Or, create a new one directly from this field, by typing in the name of the new template, and
  selecting either:

  - :guilabel:`Create` (which creates the template, and can be edited later) or
  - :guilabel:`Create and edit...` (which creates the template, and reveals a separate template page
    to configure the template in greater detail).

- :guilabel:`Tags`: add any corresponding tags to briefly describe the event (e.g. `Online`,
  `Conference`, etc.). Multiple tags can be added per event.

  .. tip::
     Tags can be displayed on events that are listed on the website by enabling the *Show on
     Website* checkbox from :menuselection:`Events app --> Configuration --> Event Tag Categories`.

- :guilabel:`Organizer`: designate the organizer of the event (a company, contact, or employee).
- :guilabel:`Responsible`: designate a user in the database to be responsible for this event.
- :guilabel:`Company`: designate which company in the database to which this event is related. This
  field **only** appears if working in a multi-company environment. This field is auto-populated,
  but modifiable, and is **required**.
- :guilabel:`Website`: choose to restrict the publishing of this event to a specific website created
  in Odoo. If this field is left blank, the event can be published on *all* websites in the
  database. To learn more, refer to the :doc:`Multiple websites
  <../../websites/website/configuration/multi_website>` documentation.
- :guilabel:`Venue`: enter event venue details. This field pulls pertinent information from the
  *Contacts* application. Alternatively, :guilabel:`Venue` information can be manually added in this
  field, as well. At the very least, there **must** be a venue name, address, city, zip code/region,
  and country entered.
- :guilabel:`Exhibition Map`: if desired, click the :guilabel:`Upload your file` button to upload an
  image of the event venue map.
- :guilabel:`Limit Registrations`: if this checkbox is ticked, a limit to the amount of
  registrations is added to the event, and that desired limit amount **must** be entered in the
  blank field before :guilabel:`Attendees`.
- :guilabel:`Badge Dimension`: select a desired paper format dimension for event badges. The options
  are: :guilabel:`A4 foldable`, :guilabel:`A6`, or :guilabel:`4 per sheet`.
- :guilabel:`Badge Background`: if desired, click the :guilabel:`Upload your file` button to upload
  a custom background image for event badges.

When the above fields in the event form have been adequately filled in, move on to the four tabs at
the bottom of the event form for further customization.

Those tabs are: :ref:`Tickets <events/event-tickets>`, :ref:`Communication
<events/event-communication>`, :ref:`Questions <events/event-questions>`, and :ref:`Notes
<events/event-notes>`.

.. _events/event-tickets:

Tickets tab
-----------

Create custom tickets (and ticket tiers) for events in the :guilabel:`Tickets` tab of an event form.

.. image:: create_events/tickets-tab.png
   :align: center
   :alt: A typical tickets tab on an event form in the Odoo Events application.

To create a ticket, click :guilabel:`Add a line` in the :guilabel:`Tickets` tab. Then, enter a name
for the ticket (e.g. `Basic Ticket` or `VIP`) in the :guilabel:`Name` field.

In the :guilabel:`Product` field, either select the pre-configured :guilabel:`Event Registration`
product, or create a new one by typing in the name of the new event registration product, and then
select either :guilabel:`Create` or :guilabel:`Create and edit...` from the resulting drop-down
menu.

.. important::
   Upon installing Odoo *Events*, a new product type, *Event Ticket*, becomes available on product
   forms (:menuselection:`Sales --> Products --> Products`). In order for an event registration
   product to be selectable in the *Tickets* tab, the event registration :guilabel:`Product Type`
   **must** be set to :guilabel:`Event Ticket`.

.. tip::
   Existing event registration products can be modified directly from this field, as well, by
   clicking the :icon:`oi-arrow-right` :guilabel:`(right arrow)` icon, located beside the event
   registration product. Doing so reveals that product's form. If the *Inventory* application is
   installed, additional choices are available to customize for the product.

Next, set the registration cost of the ticket in the :guilabel:`Price` field.

.. note::
   The *Sales Price* defined on the event registration product's product form sets the default cost
   of a ticket. Modifying the :guilabel:`Price` of a ticket in the :guilabel:`Tickets` tab, sets a
   new registration cost of the ticket for that event.

Next, determine a :guilabel:`Sales Start` and :guilabel:`Sales End` date in their respective fields.
To do that, click into the blank field to reveal a calendar popover. From there, select the desired
date and time, then click :icon:`fa-check` :guilabel:`Apply`.

Then, if desired, designate a :guilabel:`Maximum` amount of that specific ticket that can be sold.

The :guilabel:`Taken` column populates with the number of tickets that are sold.

Optionally, in the :guilabel:`Color` column, add a custom color to differentiate ticket badges. The
selected color displays on ticket badges when printed.

To delete any tickets from the :guilabel:`Tickets` tab, click the :icon:`fa-trash-o`
:guilabel:`(trash can)` icon on the corresponding line for the ticket that should be deleted.

.. tip::
   To add an optional :guilabel:`Description` column to the :guilabel:`Tickets` tab, click the
   :icon:`oi-settings-adjust` :guilabel:`(additional options)` drop-down menu, located to the
   far-right of the column titles.

   Then, tick the checkbox beside :guilabel:`Description` from the resulting drop-down menu.

   When added, the option to add brief descriptions for each event ticket appears, which can be used
   to inform attendees of any perks or amenities that may coincide with specific ticket purchases.

.. _events/event-communication:

Communication tab
-----------------

In the :guilabel:`Communication` tab of an event form, create various marketing communications that
can be scheduled to be sent at specific intervals leading up to, and following, the event.

.. image:: create_events/communication-tab.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Typical communication tab on an event form in the Odoo Events application.

.. note::
   By default, Odoo provides three separate pre-configured communications on every new event form.
   One is an email sent after each registration to confirm the purchase with the attendee. The other
   two are email event reminders that are scheduled to be sent at different time intervals leading
   up to the event to remind the recipient of the upcoming event.

To add a communication in the :guilabel:`Communication` tab, click :guilabel:`Add a line`. Then,
select the desired type of communication in the :guilabel:`Send` field. The options are:
:guilabel:`Mail`, :guilabel:`SMS`, :guilabel:`Social Post`, or :guilabel:`WhatsApp`.

There is no limit to the number of communications that can be added in the :guilabel:`Communication`
tab of an event form.

To delete a communication from the :guilabel:`Communication` tab, click the :icon:`fa-trash-o`
:guilabel:`(trash can)` icon on the corresponding communication line. Doing so removes the
communication from the event entirely.

.. important::
   The :guilabel:`Social Post` option **only** appears if the *Social Marketing* application is
   installed. The :guilabel:`WhatsApp` option **only** appears if the *WhatsApp Integration* module
   is installed.

   :doc:`WhatsApp <../../productivity/whatsapp>` templates **cannot** be edited during active
   configuration. A separate approval from *Meta* is required.

Mail
~~~~

Select an existing email template from the :guilabel:`Template` drop-down menu.

Next, define the :guilabel:`Interval`, :guilabel:`Unit`, and :guilabel:`Trigger` from their
respective drop-down fields, letting Odoo know when the communication should be sent.

The :guilabel:`Unit` options are: :guilabel:`Immediately`, :guilabel:`Hours`, :guilabel:`Days`,
:guilabel:`Weeks`, and :guilabel:`Months`.

Then, select an option from the :guilabel:`Trigger` drop-down menu. The options are:
:guilabel:`After each registration`, :guilabel:`Before the event`, and :guilabel:`After the event`.

The :guilabel:`Sent` column populates with the number of sent communications. And, beside the
number are different icons that appear, depending on the status of that particular communication.

The status of *Running* is represented by a :icon:`fa-cogs` :guilabel:`(three gears)` icon. The
status of *Sent* is represented by a :icon:`fa-check` :guilabel:`(checkmark)` icon. And, the status
of *Scheduled* is represented by an :icon:`fa-hourglass-half` :guilabel:`(hourglass)` icon.

.. example::
   To send a confirmation email an hour after an attendee registers for an event, configure the
   following communication:

   - :guilabel:`Interval`: `1`
   - :guilabel:`Unit`: :guilabel:`Hours`
   - :guilabel:`Trigger`: :guilabel:`After each registration`

.. note::
   Existing email templates can be modified directly from the :guilabel:`Template` drop-down menu,
   if necessary, by clicking the :icon:`oi-arrow-right` :guilabel:`(right arrow)` icon next to the
   template name. Doing so reveals a separate page where users can edit the :guilabel:`Content`,
   :guilabel:`Email Configuration`, and :guilabel:`Settings` of that particular email template.

   To view and manage all email templates, activate :ref:`developer-mode` and navigate to
   :menuselection:`Settings --> Technical --> Email: Email Templates`. Modify with caution as email
   templates effect all communications where the template is used.

.. _events/event-questions:

Questions tab
-------------

In the :guilabel:`Questions` tab of an event form, users can create brief questionnaires for
registrants to interact with, and respond to, after they register for the event.

These questions can be focused on gathering basic information about the attendee, learning about
their preferences, expectations, and other things of that nature. This information can also be used
to create more detailed reporting metrics, in addition to being utilized to create specific lead
generation rules.

.. image:: create_events/questions-tab.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Typical questions tab on an event form in the Odoo Events application.

.. note::
   By default, Odoo provides three questions in the :guilabel:`Questions` tab for every event form.
   The default questions require the registrant(s) to provide their :guilabel:`Name` and
   :guilabel:`Email`, and make it optional to include their :guilabel:`Phone` number, as well.

   The information gathered from the :guilabel:`Questions` tab can be found on the
   :guilabel:`Attendees` dashboard, accessible via the :icon:`fa-users` :guilabel:`Attendees` smart
   button. Odoo populates individual records that contain basic information about the registrant(s),
   as well as their preferences.

To add a question in the :guilabel:`Questions` tab, click :guilabel:`Add a line`. Doing so reveals a
:guilabel:`Create Question` pop-up window. From here, users can create and configure their question.

.. image:: create_events/create-question-popup.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The Create Question pop-up window that appears in the Odoo Events application.

First, enter the question in the field at the top of the form. Then, decide if the question should
require a :guilabel:`Mandatory Answer` and/or if Odoo should :guilabel:`Ask once per order`, by
ticking their respective boxes, if desired.

If the :guilabel:`Ask once per order` checkbox is ticked, the question will only be asked once, and
its value is propogated to every attendee in the order (if multiple tickets are purchased at once).
If the checkbox is *not* ticked for this setting, Odoo will present the question for every attendee
that is connected to that registration.

Next, select a :guilabel:`Question Type` option:

- :guilabel:`Selection`: provide answer options to the question for registrants to choose from.
  Selectable answer options can be managed in the :guilabel:`Answers` column at the bottom of the
  pop-up window.
- :guilabel:`Text Input`: lets the users enter a custom response to the question in a text field.
- :guilabel:`Name`: provides registrants with a field for them to enter their name.
- :guilabel:`Email`: provides registrants with a field for them to enter their email address.
- :guilabel:`Phone`: provides registrants with a field for them to enter their phone number.
- :guilabel:`Company`: provides registrants with a field for them to enter a company they are
  associated with.

Once all the desired configurations have been entered, either click :guilabel:`Save & Close` to save
the question, and return to the :guilabel:`Questions` tab on the event form, or click
:guilabel:`Save & New` to save the question and immediately create a new question on a new
:guilabel:`Create Question` pop-up window.

As questions are added to the :guilabel:`Questions` tab, the informative columns showcase the
configurations of each question.

The informative columns are the following:

- :guilabel:`Title`
- :guilabel:`Mandatory`
- :guilabel:`Once per Order`
- :guilabel:`Type`
- :guilabel:`Answers` (if applicable)

For :guilabel:`Selection` and :guilabel:`Text Input` types, a :icon:`fa-bar-chart` :guilabel:`Stats`
button appears on the right side of the question line. When clicked, Odoo reveals a separate page,
showcasing the response metrics to that specific question.

To delete any question from the :guilabel:`Questions` tab, click the :icon:`fa-trash-o`
:guilabel:`(trash can)` icon on the corresponding question line.

There is no limit to the number of questions that can be added in the :guilabel:`Questions` tab of
an event form.

.. _events/event-notes:

Notes tab
---------

In the :guilabel:`Notes` tab of an event form, users can leave detailed internal notes and/or
event-related instructions/information for attendees.

.. image:: create_events/notes-tab.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Typical notes tab on an event form in the Odoo Events application.

In the :guilabel:`Note` field of the :guilabel:`Notes` tab, users can leave internal notes for other
event employees, like "to-do" lists, contact information, instructions, and so on.

In the :guilabel:`Ticket Instructions` field of the :guilabel:`Notes` tab, users can leave specific
instructions for people attending the event that appear on the attendees ticket.

Publish events
==============

Once all configurations and modifications are complete on the event form, it is time to publish the
event on the website. Doing so makes the event visible to website visitors, and makes it possible
for people to register for the event.

To publish an event after all the customizations are complete, click the :icon:`fa-globe`
:guilabel:`Go to Website` smart button at the top of the event form. Doing so reveals the event's
web page, which can be customized like any other web page on the site, via the :guilabel:`Edit`
button.

To learn more about website design functionality and options, consult the :doc:`Building block
<../../websites/website/web_design/building_blocks>` documentation.

Once the event website is ready to be shared, click the red :guilabel:`Unpublished` toggle switch
in the header menu, changing it to a green :guilabel:`Published` switch. At this point, the event
web page is published, and viewable/accessible by all website visitors.

Event booths
============

The Odoo *Events* application provides users with the ability to create event booths, sell their
availability, and manage their reservations.

Configuration
=============

In order to create, sell, and manage booths for events, the *Booth Management* feature must be
activated.

To do that, navigate to :menuselection:`Events app --> Configuration --> Settings`, and tick the
:guilabel:`Booth Management` checkbox. Then, click :guilabel:`Save`.

.. image:: event_booths/booth-management-setting.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The Booth Management setting in the Odoo Events application.

.. important::
   When the :guilabel:`Booth Management` setting is activated, a new :doc:`Product Type
   <../../inventory_and_mrp/inventory/product_management/configure/type>` becomes available on all
   product forms: *Event Booth*.

   This is important because every created booth **must** be assigned a *Booth Category* on their
   respective booth form, and every booth category **must** have an *Event Booth* product assigned
   to it.

Booth categories
================

With the *Booth Management* setting activated in the *Events* app, the *Booth Categories* option
appears in the :guilabel:`Configuration` menu.

To access the :guilabel:`Booth Category` dashboard, go to :menuselection:`Events app -->
Configuration --> Booth Categories`, which reveals a list of all created booth categories.

.. image:: event_booths/booth-category-page.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The Booth Category page in the Odoo Events application.

On the :guilabel:`Booth Category` page, the following information for each booth category is listed:

- :guilabel:`Name`: the name of the booth category.
- :guilabel:`Create Sponsor`: if checked, booking this booth category creates a sponsor for the
  user.
- :guilabel:`Product`: the *Event Booth* product associated with that specific booth category.
- :guilabel:`Price`: the price of a booth in that booth category.

When the :icon:`oi-settings-adjust` :guilabel:`(settings)` icon, located to the far-right of the
column titles, is clicked, a drop-down menu of additional column options appears. From the resulting
drop-down menu, tick the checkbox beside :guilabel:`Sponsor Level` and/or :guilabel:`Sponsor Type`
to reveal those columns on the :guilabel:`Booth Category` page.

To edit an existing booth category, select it from the list, and proceed to make any desired
modifications from the event category form.

Create booth category
---------------------

To create a booth category from the :guilabel:`Booth Category` page, click the :guilabel:`New`
button in the upper-left corner to reveal a blank booth category form.

.. image:: event_booths/booth-category-form.png
   :align: center
   :alt: A typical booth category form in the Odoo Events application.

Start by entering a name for the booth category in the top :guilabel:`Booth Category` field. This is
a **requried** field.

To add a corresponding image to the booth category (e.g. a sample photo of how the booth looks),
click the :icon:`fa-pencil` :guilabel:`(pencil)` icon that appears when the cursor hovers over the
camera placeholder in the upper-right corner of the booth category form. When clicked, proceed to
upload the desired image to the booth category form, if needed.

In the :guilabel:`Booth Details` section, users **must** assign a :guilabel:`Product` to the
category, and it **must** have *Event Booth* set as the *Product Type* on the product form.

And, regardless of the listed price on the *Event Booth* product chosen, the user can input a custom
:guilabel:`Price` to be applied for this booth category in the field below.

In the :guilabel:`Sponsorship` section, there is a :guilabel:`Create Sponsor` checkbox option. With
that checkbox ticked, whenever a booth belonging to this category is booked, the user is created as
an official *Sponsor* of the event.

When the :guilabel:`Create Sponsor` checkbox is ticked, two additional fields appear beneath it:
:guilabel:`Sponsor Level` and :guilabel:`Sponsor Type`.

.. note::
   :guilabel:`Sponsor Level` and :guilabel:`Sponsor Type` are purely to distinguish different
   distinctions of sponsors. For example, if a sponsor has been attached to a company for multiple
   years, they would be granted a higher level (e.g. *Gold* level), which provides them with
   immediate credability and status. Whereas, conversely, a relatively new sponsor would be granted
   a lower level (e.g. *Bronze* level), which coincides with its own credability and status.

Select a desired level of sponsorship from the :guilabel:`Sponsor Level` drop-down field.

.. tip::
   To modify any existing :guilabel:`Sponsor Level`, select it from the drop-down field, then click
   the :icon:`fa-arrow-right` :guilabel:`(right arrow)` that appears at the end of the line. Doing
   so opens a separate page, wherein the :guilabel:`Sponsor Level` name and :guilabel:`Ribbon Style`
   can be changed, if necessary.

Users can also create a new :guilabel:`Sponsor Level`, by typing in the name of the new level, and
clicking :guilabel:`Create and edit...` from the resulting drop-down menu.

.. note::
   Clicking :guilabel:`Create` from the resulting drop-down menu in this instance creates the
   sponsor level, but doesn't immediately prompt the user to further configure it, via a
   :guilabel:`Create Sponsor Level` pop-up window.

Doing so reveals a :guilabel:`Create Sponsor Level` pop-up window.

.. image:: event_booths/create-sponsor-level-popup.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The Create Sponsor Level pop-up window that appears in the Odoo Events application.

From this pop-up window, confirm the newly-created :guilabel:`Sponsor Level`, and decide what kind
of :guilabel:`Ribbon Style` should be applied, if any. The :guilabel:`Ribbon Style` options
available in that drop-down field are: :guilabel:`No Ribbon`, :guilabel:`Gold`, :guilabel:`Silver`,
and :guilabel:`Bronze`.

If one is selected, that :guilabel:`Ribbon Style` appears with the sponsor's name on the event
website.

On the booth category form, beneath those sections (:guilabel:`Booth Details` and
:guilabel:`Sponsorship`), there is the :guilabel:`Description` tab. In this tab, proceed to enter
any vital information related to the booth category that would be important for any potential
booth-buyer to know about (e.g., the square footage, any amenities, size of display screen, etc.).

Add booth to an event
=====================

In order to add a booth to an event, navigate to an existing event form, via :menuselection:`Events
app --> Events`, and select the desired event from the :guilabel:`Events` dashboard. Or, click
:guilabel:`New` to open a blank event form.

From the event form, to access the *Booths* for that specific event, click the :guilabel:`Booths`
smart button at the top of the page.

The :guilabel:`Booths` page is displayed in a Kanban view, by default, with two different stages:
:guilabel:`Available` and :guilabel:`Unavailable`.

.. note::
   The :guilabel:`Booths` page of an event is also viewable in a :icon:`oi-view-list`
   :guilabel:`List` view, :icon:`fa-area-chart` :guilabel:`Graph` view, and :icon:`oi-view-pivot`
   :guilabel:`Pivot` view. All of which are accessible, via their icons, in the upper-right corner
   of the :guilabel:`Booths` page.

The booths present in the :guilabel:`Available` stage are still available for people to purchase for
the event. The booths present in the :guilabel:`Unavailable` stage have already been purchased, and
are no longer available.

To modify any existing booth, simply click the desired booth from the :guilabel:`Booths` page, and
proceed to make any necessary changes from the booth form. Or, create a new one, by clicking the
:guilabel:`New` button in the upper-left corner to reveal a blank booth form.

Booth form
----------

The booth form in Odoo *Events* lets users customize and configure event booths in a number of
different ways.

.. image:: event_booths/booth-form.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Typical booth form in the Odoo Events application.

Start by typing in a :guilabel:`Name` for the booth. This is a **required** field.

Then, apply a :guilabel:`Booth Category` to the booth. This is a **required** field.

.. tip::
   A new :guilabel:`Booth Category` can be created from this field, by typing in the name of the
   new category, and clicking :guilabel:`Create and edit...` from the resulting drop-down menu.
   Doing so reveals a :guilabel:`Create Booth Category` pop-up window, with all the standard fields
   found on a common booth category form.

   Simply clicking :guilabel:`Create` from the resulting drop-down menu creates the category, but
   does not reveal the :guilabel:`Create Booth Category` pop-up window. The category would have to
   be modified later, via the *Booth Categories* page (:menuselection:`Events app --> Configuration
   --> Booth Categories`).

Upon selecting a pre-existing :guilabel:`Booth Category`, two additional, non-modifiable fields
appear: :guilabel:`Product` and :guilabel:`Price`. Both fields represent their respective selections
for that specific booth category.

When a person purchases a booth rental through the event website, the subsequent renter-related
fields on the form auto-populate, based on the information provided by the purchaser during the
online transaction. The booth also automatically changes its status from *Available* to
*Unavailable*.

However, if the rental of a booth is conducted in any other way (e.g., in person, via sales order,
etc.), the :guilabel:`Renter`, :guilabel:`Renter Name`, :guilabel:`Renter Email`, and
:guilabel:`Renter Phone` fields can be entered in manually.

The status of the booth (:guilabel:`Available` or :guilabel:`Unavailable`) can also be changed
manually, either by clicking the appropriate status from the status bar present on the booth form,
or by dragging-and-dropping the desired booth into the appropriate stage, via the *Booths* page
Kanban view.

Sell event booths
=================

With event booths configured on the event form, via the event-specific *Booths* pages, Odoo presents
them on the event website, via the *Get A Booth* event subheader link.

To access the *Get A Booth* page on the event website, open the :menuselection:`Events app`, and
select the desired event from the :guilabel:`Events` dashboard. From the event form, click the
:guilabel:`Go to Website` smart button to be taken to the Odoo-built event website.

If the event subheader menu (with the :guilabel:`Get A Booth` option) is *not* showing up on the
event website, there are two ways to make it appear.

While on the event website, enter the edit mode by clicking the :guilabel:`Edit` button in the
upper-right corner. Then, click into the :guilabel:`Customize` tab of the resulting sidebar of web
design tools.

In the :guilabel:`Customize` tab, click the toggle switch for :guilabel:`Sub-Menu (Specific)`, and
click :guilabel:`Save`. Doing so reveals the event subheader menu with various options.

Alternatively, enter :doc:`Debug mode <../../general/developer_mode>`, and open the specific event
form in the the *Events* application.

On the event form, with *Debug mode* on, an array of subheader menu options appears. Tick the
checkbox for :guilabel:`Website Submenu`, in order for the submenu to appear on the event website.
Doing so also ticks every other submenu-related checkbox automatically.

At this point, proceed to choose which options to keep on the event subheader menu. In this case,
make sure the :guilabel:`Booth Register` checkbox is ticked.

From there, click the :guilabel:`Get A Booth` event subheader menu option. Doing so reveals the
:guilabel:`Get A Booth` page, showcasing all the configured event booths that were created on the
event form.

.. image:: event_booths/get-a-booth-page.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Typical Get A Booth page on the event website via the Odoo Events app.

From here, the visitor can select their desired booth option, then :guilabel:`Location`. Next, they
would click the :guilabel:`Book my Booth(s)` button, located at the bottom of the :guilabel:`Get A
Booth` page.

Doing so reveals a :guilabel:`Contact Details` page, wherein they fill out either *Contact Details*
or *Sponsor Details*, depending on how the booth was configured on the event form. The fields
present on this form vary, depending on whether its meant for a basic contact or an event sponsor.

.. note::
   If the selected booth has the *Create Sponsor* checkbox ticked, this page reads as *Sponsor
   Details*.

The information provided on this details page is used to auto-populate the renter-related
information on the booth form on the event form in the *Events* application.

Once the necessary information has been entered, the visitor then clicks the :guilabel:`Go to
Payment` at the bottom of the page, and proceeds to complete the typical checkout process.

Upon a successful payment confirmation, that selected booth automatically moves to the *Unavailable*
stage on the event-specific *Booths* page in the *Events* application (accessible via the *Booths*
smart button on the event form).

Also, the provided *Sponsor* information (if applicable) and *Sales Order* information are
accessible from the specific event form, via their respective smart buttons that appear at the top
of the form.

.. note::
   Click the *Sponsors* smart button to modify any information about the sponsor, if necessary.

==================================================

===============
Event templates
===============

The Odoo *Events* application provides the ability to customize and configure event templates, which
can be used to expedite the event-creation process.

These templates can be created and personalized in the application, and then selected from an event
form, in order to quickly apply a series of settings and elements to the new event, all of which can
be further modified, if needed.

Event templates page
====================

In the Odoo *Events* application, event templates can quickly be created and modified.

To begin, navigate to :menuselection:`Events app --> Configuration --> Event Templates`. Doing so
reveals the :guilabel:`Event Templates` page. Here, find all the existing event templates in the
database.

.. image:: event_templates/event-templates-page.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The Event Templates page in the Odoo Events application.

By default, Odoo provides three pre-configured event templates: :guilabel:`Exhibition`,
:guilabel:`Training`, and :guilabel:`Sport`, which all have their own unique customizations applied
to them.

To change how these event templates appear on the *Template* drop-down field on an event form,
drag-and-drop them into any desired order, using the :icon:`oi-draggable` :guilabel:`(draggable)`
icon, located to the left of each event template line on the :guilabel:`Event Templates` page.

.. seealso::
   To learn more about event forms, refer to the :doc:`create_events` documentation.

Create event template
=====================

There are two ways to create and configure an event template in Odoo *Events*.

#. **On the dashboard**, by navigating to :menuselection:`Events app --> Configuration --> Event
   Templates` and clicking the :guilabel:`New` button in the upper-left corner. Doing so reveals a
   blank event template form that can be customized in a number of different ways.
#. **On an event form itself**. Start by typing the name of a new event template in the *Template*
   field, and click :guilabel:`Create and edit...` from the resulting drop-down menu. Doing so
   reveals a *Create Template* pop-up window, featuring all the same configurable fields and
   elements found on a standard event template form.

.. note::
   Clicking :guilabel:`Create "[template name]"` from the resulting drop-down menu, via the
   *Template* field on an event form creates the event template in the database, but does **not**
   present the user with the *Create Template* pop-up window.

   The event template would have to be modified, by selecting it on the *Event Templates* page
   (:menuselection:`Events app --> Configuration --> Event Templates`).

Event template form
-------------------

All the fields on a standard :guilabel:`Event Template` form are *also* on the *Create Template*
pop-up window, accessible via the *Template* field on an event form.

.. image:: event_templates/event-template-form.png
   :align: center
   :alt: A standard event template form in the Odoo Events application.

Start by providing the event template with a name in the :guilabel:`Event Template` field, located
at the top of the form.

Beneath that field, there is a series of selectable checkboxes, all of which are related to how the
event menu will be displayed on the event web page.

- :guilabel:`Website Submenu`: enables a submenu on the event's website. When this checkbox is
  ticked, every other checkbox in this series is automatically ticked, as well. Then, choose to
  untick (deselect) any of the checkbox options, as desired.
- :guilabel:`Tracks Menu Item`: adds a submenu item to navigate to a page displaying all planned
  tracks for the event.
- :guilabel:`Track Proposals Menu Item`: adds a submenu item to navigate to a page, in which
  visitors can fill out a form to propose a track (talk, lecture, presentation, etc.) to happen
  during the event.
- :guilabel:`Booth Menu Item`: adds a submenu item that takes visitors to a separate page, where an
  event booth can be purchased. Event booths can be customized and configured in the
  :guilabel:`Booths` tab of the event template form, from the *Booth Categories* page
  (:menuselection:`Events app --> Configuration --> Booth Categories`).

  .. important::
     First, users **must** create a booth product with the required *Event Booth* option set as the
     :guilabel:`Product Type` on the product form.

- :guilabel:`Exhibitors Menu Item`: adds a submenu item that takes visitors to a separate page,
  showcasing all the exhibitors related to that specific event. Icons representing those exhibitors
  are also found on the footer of every event-specific web page, as well.
- :guilabel:`Community`: adds a submenu item allowing attendees to access pre-configured virtual
  community rooms to meet with other attendees, and discuss various topics related to the event.
  When this checkbox is ticked, the :guilabel:`Allow Room Creation` feature becomes available.
- :guilabel:`Allow Room Creation`: allow visitors to create community rooms of their own.
- :guilabel:`Register Button`: adds a button at the end of the event submenu that takes visitors to
  the event-specific registration page when clicked.

Once the desired checkboxes have been ticked, select an appropriate :guilabel:`Timezone` for the
event from the available drop-down menu.

Then, for organizational purposes, there is the option to add :guilabel:`Tags` to this event
template.

There is also the option to :guilabel:`Limit Registrations` to this specific event template by
ticking that checkbox. If ticked, proceed to enter the number of :guilabel:`Attendees` this template
should be limited to.

Beneath those general information fields at the top of the event template form, there are five tabs:

- :ref:`Tickets <events/event-tickets>`
- :ref:`Communication <events/event-communication>`
- :ref:`Booths <event_templates/event_template/booths>`
- :ref:`Questions <events/event-questions>`
- :ref:`Notes <events/event-notes>`

.. _event_templates/event_template/booths:

Booths tab
~~~~~~~~~~

The :guilabel:`Booths` tab on an event template form is the only tab that differentiates itself from
a standard event form, where the other tabs (:guilabel:`Tickets`, :guilabel:`Communication`,
:guilabel:`Questions`, and :guilabel:`Notes`) are present and configured using the same process. For
more information about those tabs, refer to the :doc:`create_events` documentation.

.. important::
   To create a booth or booth category, an event booth product **must** be created in the database
   first, with the *Product Type* set to *Event Booth*. **Only** products with that specific
   configuration can be selected in the required *Product* field of a booth or booth category form.

.. note::
   Event booths can be created and customized in two ways in the Odoo *Events* application. Either
   in the :guilabel:`Booths` tab of an event template form, or by navigating to
   :menuselection:`Events app --> Configuration --> Booth Categories`, and click :guilabel:`New`.

To add a booth from the :guilabel:`Booths` tab of an event template form, click :guilabel:`Add a
line`. Doing so reveals a blank :guilabel:`Create Booths` pop-up window.

.. image:: event_templates/create-booths-popup.png
   :align: center
   :alt: A Create Booths pop-up window in the Odoo Events application.

Start by providing a :guilabel:`Name` for this booth in the corresponding field at the top of the
pop-up window.

Then, select an appropriate :guilabel:`Booth Category` from the drop-down field below. Booth
categories can be created and modified from the *Booth Categories* page in the *Events* application,
which is accessible by navigating to :menuselection:`Events app --> Configuration --> Booth
Categories`.

.. tip::
   A :guilabel:`Booth Category` can be created directly from this field on the :guilabel:`Create
   Booths` pop-up window. To accomplish that, type the name of the new booth category in the
   :guilabel:`Booth Category` field, and select either :guilabel:`Create` or :guilabel:`Create and
   edit...` from the resulting drop-down menu.

   Clicking :guilabel:`Create` merely creates the category, which can (and should be) customized at
   a later date. Clicking :guilabel:`Create and edit...` reveals a new :guilabel:`Create Booth
   Category` pop-up window, from which the category can be configured in a number of different ways.

   .. image:: event_templates/create-booth-category-popup.png
      :align: center
      :alt: The Create Booth Category pop-up window in the Odoo Events application.

   From this pop-up window, proceed to name the :guilabel:`Booth Category`, modify its
   :guilabel:`Booth Details` settings, configure its :guilabel:`Sponsorship` options (if
   applicable), and leave an optional :guilabel:`Description` to explain any pertinent details
   related to this specific category of booths.

   There is also the option to add a photo/visual representation of the booth category, via the
   :guilabel:`(camera)` icon in the upper-right corner.

   When all desired configurations are complete, click the :guilabel:`Save & Close` button.

   The same configurations and options are available by navigating to :menuselection:`Events app -->
   Configuration --> Booth Categories`, and clicking :guilabel:`New`.

Once the desired :guilabel:`Booth Category` is selected, the remaining fields on the
:guilabel:`Create Booths` pop-up window (:guilabel:`Currency`, :guilabel:`Product`, and
:guilabel:`Price`) autopopulate, based on information configured for that selected :guilabel:`Booth
Category`.

.. note::
   These fields **cannot** be modified from the :guilabel:`Create Booths` pop-up window. They can
   only be modified from the specific booth category form page.

When all desired configurations are complete, click :guilabel:`Save & Close` to save the booth, and
return to the event template form. Or, click :guilabel:`Save & New` to save the booth, and start
creating another booth on a fresh :guilabel:`Create Booths` pop-up window. Click :guilabel:`Discard`
to remove all changes, and return to the event template form.

Once the booth has been saved, it appears in the :guilabel:`Booths` tab on the event template form.

Use event templates
===================

Once an event template is complete, it is accessible on all event forms in the Odoo *Events*
application.

To use an event template, navigate to the :menuselection:`Events app` and click :guilabel:`New` to
open a new event form.

From the event form, click the :guilabel:`Template` field to reveal all the existing event templates
in the database. They appear in the same order as they are listed in on the *Event Templates* page
(:menuselection:`Events app --> Configuration --> Event Templates`).

Select the desired event template from the :guilabel:`Template` drop-down field on the event form.
Pre-configured settings automatically populate the event form, saving time during the event creation
process.

Any of these pre-configured settings related to the selected event template chosen in the
:guilabel:`Template` field on an event form can be modified, as desired.

============
Event tracks
============

Odoo *Events* provides the ability to create, schedule, and manage talks, lectures, demonstrations,
presentations, etc., which known as *Tracks* in Odoo.

The Odoo *Events* application also has an option to allow event attendees to propose talks (tracks)
for an event, which can then be approved (or disapproved).

Configuration
=============

First, there are some settings that need to be enabled, in order to get the most out of event
tracks.

To do that, navigate to :menuselection:`Events app --> Configuration --> Settings`, and tick the
checkbox beside the :guilabel:`Schedule & Tracks` setting. Doing so provides the ability to manage
and publish an event schedule with various tracks.

Also, when that setting checkbox is ticked, two additional setting options appear beneath it:
:guilabel:`Live Broadcast` and :guilabel:`Event Gamification`.

.. image:: event_tracks/track-settings.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The Schedule and Tracks setting in the Odoo Events app, along with corresponding options.

The :guilabel:`Live Broadcast` option provides the ability to air tracks online through a *YouTube*
integration.

The :guilabel:`Event Gamification` options provides the ability to share a quiz with track attendees
once the track is over, in order to test how much they learned.

.. note::
   With the :guilabel:`Event Gamification` setting enabled, an :guilabel:`Add Quiz` button appears
   on track forms, providing the ability to :ref:`quickly create a quiz <events/track-add-quiz>`
   specific to the topic related to that particular track.

Once all desired settings have been enabled, be sure to click the :guilabel:`Save` button in the
upper-left corner of the :guilabel:`Settings` page.

Event Tracks page
=================

To access, modify, and/or create tracks for an event, first navigate to a preconfigured event, or
:doc:`create a new one <create_events>` from the *Events* application.

To do that, navigate to :menuselection:`Events app`, and either select a pre-existing event from the
:guilabel:`Events` dashboard, or create a new one by clicking :guilabel:`New`.

Once on the desired event form, click into the :guilabel:`Tracks` smart button at the top of the
form.

.. tip::
   If the :guilabel:`Tracks` smart button is not readily available, click the :guilabel:`More`
   :icon:`fa-sort-desc` drop-down menu to reveal hidden smart buttons. Then, click
   :guilabel:`Tracks` from the resulting drop-down menu.

Clicking the :guilabel:`Tracks` smart button reveals the :guilabel:`Event Tracks` page for that
particular event, which presents all the tracks (both scheduled and proposed) for the event, if
there are any.

   :align: center
   :alt: Typical event tracks page for an event in the Odoo Events application.

The tracks are presented in a default :icon:`oi-view-kanban` :guilabel:`(Kanban)` view, but there is
also the option to view these tracks in a :icon:`oi-view-list` :guilabel:`(List)`,
:icon:`oi-view-cohort` :guilabel:`(Gantt)` chart, :icon:`fa-calendar-check-o`
:guilabel:`(Calendar)`, :icon:`fa-area-chart` :guilabel:`(Graph)`, or :icon:`fa-clock-o`
:guilabel:`(Activity)` view. All of which are accessible in the upper-right corner of the
:guilabel:`Tracks` page.

In the default :icon:`oi-view-kanban` :guilabel:`(Kanban)` view, the tracks are categorized into
different stages. The default stages are: :guilabel:`Proposal`, :guilabel:`Confirmed`,
:guilabel:`Announced`, :guilabel:`Published`, :guilabel:`Refused` (collapsed stage), and
:guilabel:`Cancelled` (collapsed stage). All of which can be edited, if needed.

.. tip::
   To edit a stage, hover over the stage name, click the :icon:`fa-cog` :guilabel:`(Settings)` icon,
   and select :guilabel:`Edit` from the resulting drop-down menu.

Clicking into a track from the :guilabel:`Event Tracks` page reveals the track form for that
particular track.

Create event track
------------------

From the :guilabel:`Event Tracks` page, click :guilabel:`New` in the upper-left corner to reveal a
blank event track form to create an event track.

.. image:: event_tracks/event-track-form.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Typical event track form in the Odoo Events application.

Start by giving this track a :guilabel:`Title`. This field is **required** by Odoo.

Then, if desired, add an accompanying image to the track via the :icon:`fa-pencil`
:guilabel:`(pencil)` icon that appears when the cursor hovers over the :icon:`fa-camera`
:guilabel:`(camera)` icon in the upper-right corner of the form. When clicked, proceed to upload the
desired image for the track. This image appears on the front-end of the event website, on this
specific tracks webpage.

Next, enter a :guilabel:`Track Date` and time for the track, and designate a :guilabel:`Location`
where the talk is planning to be held.

.. tip::
   To access a complete list of locations for event tracks, which can be modified (and added to) at
   any time, navigate to :menuselection:`Events app --> Configuration --> Track Locations`.

Then, add a :guilabel:`Duration` to the track (in minutes).

If the *Live Broadcast* setting has been enabled in the *Events* app settings, the option to add a
corresponding link in the :guilabel:`YouTube Video Link` field is available.

If the :guilabel:`Always Wishlisted` checkbox is ticked, the talk is automatically set as a favorite
for each registered event attendee.

Assign someone to be in charge of managing this track in the :guilabel:`Responsible` field. By
default, the person who initially created the track is assigned.

Then, ensure the track is applied to the correct event in the :guilabel:`Event` field. By default,
this field is auto-populated with the event related to the *Event Tracks* page the track was
originally created from.

Next, choose to add existing tags, or create new ones, to further organize the track. These tags,
and their corresponding tag categories are utilized on the event specific website - mainly on the
*Talks* web page on the event website, via the drop-down filter menus.

Beneath that general information section, there are three tabs: :ref:`Speaker
<events/track-speaker-tab>`, :ref:`Description <events/track-description-tab>`, and
:ref:`Interactivity <events/track-interactivity-tab>`.

.. _events/track-speaker-tab:

The :guilabel:`Contact Email` and :guilabel:`Contact Phone` fields are greyed-out and populated with
the information found on that chosen contact's contact form. These fields are not modifiable once
the :guilabel:`Contact` field is selected.

Speaker Bio section
*******************

In the :guilabel:`Speaker Bio` section, proceed to enter information related to the specific speaker
scheduled to conduct/host the track. This section may auto-populate based on the :guilabel:`Contact`
selected in the :guilabel:`Contact Details` section. If not, enter information in the necessary
fields.

.. note::
   This information appears on the front-end of the event website, on the specific track webpage,
   providing more information about the speaker to the track attendees.

Start by entering a :guilabel:`Name`, :guilabel:`Email`, and :guilabel:`Phone` number for the
speaker.

Next, if desired, add an image to appear alongside the speaker biogrpahy on the event website, via
the :icon:`fa-pencil` :guilabel:`(pencil)` icon that appears when the cursor hovers over the
:icon:`fa-camera` :guilabel:`(camera)` icon. When clicked, proceed to upload the desired image for
the speaker.

Then, enter a :guilabel:`Job Position` for the designated speaker, followed by the
:guilabel:`Company Name` associated with the speaker.

In the :guilabel:`Biography` field, proceed to enter in a custom biography with any speaker-related
information.

.. _events/track-description-tab:

Description tab
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :guilabel:`Description` tab of an event track form is a blank text field, in which a description
of the track can be entered. The information entered here appears on the specific track page on the
event website.

.. _events/track-interactivity-tab:

Interactivity tab
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :guilabel:`Interactivity` tab on an event track form features a single option at first:
:guilabel:`Magic Button`.

.. image:: event_tracks/interactivity-tab.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The Interactivity tab on an event track form in the Odoo Events application.

When the checkbox beside :guilabel:`Magic Button` is ticked, Odoo displays a *call to action* button
to attendees on the track sidebar, while the track is taking place.

With that checkbox ticked, three more options appear, all of which are related to the
:guilabel:`Magic Button`:

- :guilabel:`Button Title`: enter a title to appear on the button for attendees.
- :guilabel:`Button Target URL`: enter a URL that leads attendees, who click the button, to a
  specific page.
- :guilabel:`Show Button`: enter a number in the field, and the button will appear that number of
  :guilabel:`minutes after Track start`.

.. note::
   The magic button **only** appears if there is more than one published track.

.. _events/track-add-quiz:

Add Quiz button
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :guilabel:`Add Quiz` button **only** appears on event track forms if the *Event Gamification*
setting is enabled in the Odoo *Events* settings.

To add a quiz to the event track, click the :guilabel:`Add Quiz` button. Doing so reveals a separate
page where an event track quiz can be created and configured.

.. image:: event_tracks/add-quiz.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The Add Quiz page in the Odoo Events application for an event track.

Start by entering a title for the quiz in the blank field at the top of the page. Then, if
participants should be allowed to try the quiz multiple times, tick the checkbox beside
:guilabel:`Allow multiple tries`.

The :guilabel:`Event` and :guilabel:`Event Track` fields are non-modifiable, and show the
corresponding event and track this quiz is associated with.

To add questions to the quiz, click :guilabel:`Add a line` beneath the :guilabel:`Question` column.
Doing so reveals a :guilabel:`Create Questions` pop-up window.

.. image:: event_tracks/create-questions.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The Create Questions pop-up window on an event-specific track quiz in the Odoo Events app.

.. note::
   **All** track quiz questions are multiple choice.

From the pop-up window, enter the question in the blank field at the top. Then, click :guilabel:`Add
a line` to add answer options. Upon clicking :guilabel:`Add a line`, a new line appears, in which an
answer option can be entered.

Once an answer option has been entered, proceed to designate whether it is the :guilabel:`Correct`
response, by ticking the checkbox in the :guilabel:`Correct` column.

Then, there is the option to add a point value in the :guilabel:`Points` column.

And, if there are any additional comments that should accompany an answer option, type them into the
:guilabel:`Extra Comment` field.

.. note::
   The :guilabel:`Correct`, :guilabel:`Points`, and :guilabel:`Extra Comment` fields are all
   optional.

Repeat this process for all the answer options.

To remove an answer option, click the :icon:`fa-trash-o` :guilabel:`(trash can)` icon on the
far-right.

Once all desired answer options (and their configurations) are complete, click :guilabel:`Save &
Close` to save the question, close the pop-up window, and return to the track quiz form. Or, click
:guilabel:`Save & New` to save this question, and instantly start creating another question on a new
:guilabel:`Create Questions` pop-up form.

To remove any question from the quiz, click the :icon:`fa-trash-o` :guilabel:`(trash can)` icon on
the far-right of the question line.

Publish event track
===================

Once all the desired configurations are complete on an event track form, click the desired stage it
should be in from the status bar in the upper-right corner (e.g. :guilabel:`Confirmed`,
:guilabel:`Announced`, etc.).

.. note::
   The stage of a track can also be changed from the :guilabel:`Event Tracks` page, where the
   desired track card can be dragged-and-dropped into the appropriate Kanban stage.

If an event track has *not* been published yet, and it is moved to the :guilabel:`Published` stage,
Odoo automatically publishes the track on the event website.

An event track can *also* be published by opening the desired event track form, and clicking the
:guilabel:`Go to Website` smart button. Then, in order for the track page to be viewable (and
accessible) for event attendees, toggle the :icon:`fa-toggle-off` :guilabel:`Unpublished` switch at
the top of the page to :icon:`fa-toggle-on` :guilabel:`Published`; thus turning it from red to
green, and making it accessible for attendees.

==================================================

=================
Registration Desk
=================

Use the *Registration Desk* feature in Odoo **Events** to grant access to registered event attendees
as they arrive, and store attendee-related data in the reporting metrics.

Registration Desk page
======================

On a mobile device (on the Odoo app or in a browser), open the :menuselection:`Events app`, and
click the :guilabel:`Registration Desk` to view the :guilabel:`Registration Desk` page.

.. image:: registration_desk/registration-desk-page.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The Registration Desk page in the Odoo Events application.

At the bottom of the :guilabel:`Registration Desk` box, there are options to either :guilabel:`Scan
a badge` or :guilabel:`Select Attendee`.

Scan a badge
============

Scan the codes present on event attendee badges, by navigating to :menuselection:`Events app -->
Registration Desk`, and selecting the :guilabel:`Scan a badge` option.

.. important::
   Odoo **must** be granted access to the camera being used for the :guilabel:`Scan a badge` option
   to work.

Once Odoo has access to the camera, a :guilabel:`Barcode Scanner` pop-up window appears, showing the
camera's point-of-view. There is also a specified view finder box present, whose size can be
manually modified, accordingly, using the :icon:`fa-crop` :guilabel:`(crop)` icon.

.. image:: registration_desk/barcode-scanner-window.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The Barcode Scanner window of the Registration Desk in the Odoo Events application.

When the badge code is in the middle of the view finder box, the code is scanned, the
:guilabel:`Barcode Scanner` pop-up window disappears, and the attendee is granted access to the
event. Once the code is scanned, their attendance is logged in the Odoo **Events** app.

If the barcode being scanned is invalid, an error pop-up message appears in the upper-right corner.

Select attendee
===============

Manually grant access to event attendees, by navigating to :menuselection:`Events app -->
Registration Desk`, and selecting the :guilabel:`Select Attendee` option.

Odoo reveals an :guilabel:`Attendees` page, with all the attendees for every event in the database,
in a default :icon:`oi-view-kanban` :guilabel:`Kanban` view.

.. image:: registration_desk/attendees-page.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The Attendees page, via the Registration Desk, located in the Odoo Events application.

On the :guilabel:`Attendees` page, each attendee card displays that person's name, which event they
are registered to attend, their associated company (if applicable), what ticket tier they purchased
(if applicable), along with two buttons: a :icon:`fa-check` :guilabel:`(checkmark)` and
:icon:`fa-undo` :guilabel:`(counter-clockwise arrow)`.

To grant access to a person, marking them as attended, click the :icon:`fa-check`
:guilabel:`(checkmark)` button on that attendee's card.

Click the :icon:`fa-undo` :guilabel:`(counter-clockwise arrow)` button on an attendee's card to undo
the previous action.

.. tip::
   It is recommended to use an event-specific filter on the :guilabel:`Attendees` page, via the
   search bar drop-down menu.

   To do that, click the :icon:`fa-sort-desc` :guilabel:`(down arrow)` beside the seach bar to
   reveal a drop-down menu with :guilabel:`Filters`, :guilabel:`Group By`, and :guilabel:`Favorites`
   options.

   For example, click the :guilabel:`Event` option, in the :guilabel:`Group By` column. Then, click
   away to remove the drop-down menu. Odoo reveals the :guilabel:`Attendees` page with
   event-specific columns, allowing users to locate specific event attendees.

Revenues report
===============

The Odoo **Events** application creates custom reports, based on event-related data and analytics.
These reports can either be focused on *Attendees* or *Revenues*.

The following documentation focuses on the reporting options related to event *Revenues*.

Revenues reporting page
=======================

To access the *Attendees* reporting page, navigate to :menuselection:`Events app --> Reporting -->
Revenues`.

.. image:: revenues_report/default-view.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The default view of the Revenues reporting page in the Odoo Events application.

By default, the :guilabel:`Revenues` reporting page appears as a graph (a :icon:`fa-line-chart`
:guilabel:`(Line Chart)` with :icon:`fa-database` :guilabel:`(Stacked)` data). The default filters,
:guilabel:`Non-free tickets` and :guilabel:`Event Start Date: (current year)`, are present in the
search bar.

.. tip::
   To learn more about the various graph views (and graph view options), refer to the :ref:`Graph
   views <reporting/using-graph>` documentation.

The :guilabel:`Revenues` reporting page can also be viewed as a :ref:`pivot table
<reporting/views/pivot>`, by clicking the :icon:`oi-view-pivot` :guilabel:`(Pivot)` icon in the
upper-right corner.

Measures
--------

Choosing specific :ref:`Measures <reporting/choosing-measures>` is a quick way to customize
reporting pages.

Regardless of the chosen view, the measures on the :guilabel:`Revenues` reporting page are as
follows: :guilabel:`Revenues`, :guilabel:`Untaxed Revenues`, and :guilabel:`Count`.

.. note::
   In the default graph view of the :guilabel:`Revenues` reporting page, only the
   :guilabel:`Revenues` option is set in the :guilabel:`Measures` drop-down menu.

   In graph view, only one of the :guilabel:`Measures` can be selected at a time.

   When the pivot option is selected, all :guilabel:`Measures` options are selected, by default.

- :guilabel:`Revenues`: shows the revenues generated from events.
- :guilabel:`Untaxed Revenues`: shows the untaxed revenues generated from events.
- :guilabel:`Count`: shows the total amount of registrants who attended events.

Filters and grouping options
----------------------------

To reveal a drop-down menu of filter and grouping options to create custom reports, click the
:icon:`fa-caret-down` :guilabel:`(down arrow)` to the right of the search bar.

Doing so opens a drop-down mega menu of options organized into columns: :ref:`Filters
<search/preconfigured-filters>`, :ref:`Group By <search/group>`, and :ref:`Favorites
<search/favorites>`.

.. note::
   If a time-related option has been selected from the :guilabel:`Filters` column (e.g. the default
   :guilabel:`Event Start Date: (year)` filter), a :guilabel:`Comparison` column appears, with
   comparison options for the corresponding time-related filter option selected.

   Only **one** selection can be made from the :guilabel:`Comparison` column at a time.

.. seealso::
   :doc:`../../essentials/search`

Filter options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the :guilabel:`Filters` column of the drop-down mega menu, there are various event-related
options that can be utilized to create custom reports, based on a number of specific criteria.

Multiple options in the :guilabel:`Filters` column can be selected at once.

The :guilabel:`Filters` column has the following options:

- :guilabel:`Non-free tickets`: event tickets/registrations that were **not** free.
- :guilabel:`Free`: event tickets/registrations that *were* free.
- :guilabel:`Pending payment`: event tickets/registrations that were purchased, but still have
  payment pending.
- :guilabel:`Sold`: event tickets/registrations that have been successfully sold (and paid for).
- :guilabel:`Registration Date`: Click the :icon:`fa-caret-down` :guilabel:`(down arrow)` icon to
  reveal a list of month, quarter, and year options. Select any number of these options to view a
  specific periods of time and see how many registrations happened during that time.
- :guilabel:`Upcoming/Running`: include revenue-related information for events that are either
  currently running or are going to happen in the future.
- :guilabel:`Past Events`: include revenue-related information for events that have already taken
  place.
- :guilabel:`Event Start Date`: Click the :icon:`fa-caret-down` :guilabel:`(down arrow)` icon to
  reveal a list of month, quarter, and year options. Select any number of these options to designate
  event start dates to use as filters for revenue-related event data.
- :guilabel:`Event End Date`: Click the :icon:`fa-caret-down` :guilabel:`(down arrow)` icon to
  reveal a list of month, quarter, and year options. Select any number of these options to designate
  event end dates to use as filters for revenue-related event data.
- :guilabel:`Published Events`: Select this option to show revenue-related data for published
  events.
- :guilabel:`Add Custom Filter`: Create a custom filter to analyze event-related revenue data. To
  learn more, refer to the documentation on :ref:`custom filters <search/custom-filters>`.

Group By options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the :guilabel:`Group By` column of the drop-down mega menu, there are various event-related
options to create custom groupings of data.

Multiple :guilabel:`Group By` options can be selected at once.

The :guilabel:`Group By` column has the following options:

- :guilabel:`Event Type`: Group data based on the type of event.
- :guilabel:`Event`: Organize data into individual groups, separated by events.
- :guilabel:`Product`: Group data based on the event registration product.
- :guilabel:`Ticket`: Group data based on the type of event ticket purchased by attendees.
- :guilabel:`Registration Status`: Group data based on the status of registrations.
- :guilabel:`Sale Order Status`: Group data based on the status of event-related sales orders.
- :guilabel:`Customer`: Group data based on customer records.
- :guilabel:`Add Custom Group`: Click the :icon:`fa-caret-down` :guilabel:`(down arrow)` icon to
  reveal a drop-down of grouping options. To select one, click on the desired option, and Odoo adds
  it to the :guilabel:`Group By` column. Multiple selections can be made.

Sample report: event ticket analysis (graph)
============================================

The following is an example of how various filters and grouping options can create a useful analytic
graph report related to event revenues. In this case, the configurations present data about sold or
free tickets to published events, with the metrics separated by ticket type and event.

.. image:: revenues_report/event-ticket-analysis.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The event ticket analysis sample report with unique filters and groupings in place.

To create such a report, navigate to :menuselection:`Events app --> Reporting --> Revenues`. Stay in
the default graph view, but remove the default filters from the search bar.

Then, click the :icon:`fa-caret-down` :guilabel:`(down arrow)` to the right of the search bar, to
reveal the drop-down mega menu of filter and grouping options.

From here, select :guilabel:`Free` and :guilabel:`Sold` from the :guilabel:`Filters` column.

Then, since it is desired to **only** view data related to already published events, select the
:guilabel:`Published Events` option in the :guilabel:`Filters` column, as well.

Next, in the :guilabel:`Group By` column, select the :guilabel:`Event` and :guilabel:`Ticket`
options, **in that sequential order**. Doing so first groups the data by event, *then* by ticket
type, which provides a more useful array of data to analyze.

.. important::
   The order in which the options are selected in the :guilabel:`Group By` column directly affects
   how the data is presented on the report.

From there, additional configurations can be added for more detailed data, if desired.

If no additional filters or groupings are added, Odoo presents a graphical representation of data
related to all *free* or *sold* tickets for *published events*, grouped by *event*, and organized by
*ticket* type.

Sample report: event type analysis (pivot table)
================================================

The following is an example of how various filters and grouping options can create a useful analytic
pivot table report related to event revenues. In this case, the configurations present data about
how much revenue different event types have generated, in order to gauge which events are the most
profitable.

.. image:: revenues_report/event-type-analysis.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The event type analysis sample report with unique filters and groupings in place.

First, navigate to :menuselection:`Events app --> Reporting --> Revenues`, and switch to the pivot
table view, by clicking the :icon:`oi-view-pivot` :guilabel:`(Pivot)` icon in the upper-right
corner.

Keep the default filters (:guilabel:`Non-free tickets` and :guilabel:`Event Start Date: (year)`) in
the search bar.

Next, open the :guilabel:`Measures` drop-down menu, and deselect the option for :guilabel:`Count`,
because this report is only going to focus on revenues.

Then, click :icon:`fa-plus-square` :guilabel:`Total` above the column titles, and select
:guilabel:`Event Type` from the resulting drop-down menu.

With these configurations in place, all the revenues generated from the events (and their
corresponding registrations) are displayed, organized by the event type (presented as expandable
columns).

Sell event tickets
==================

Odoo *Events* provides users with the ability to create custom event tickets (and ticket tiers),
with various price points.

It *also* allows them to sell event tickets in two different ways: via standard sales orders, and
online through an integrated website.

Odoo also simplifies the ticket-purchasing process by providing plenty of payment method options.

.. tip::
   To learn more about how to create custom tickets (and ticket tiers) for events, check out the
   :doc:`create_events` documentation.

Configuration
=============

In order to sell event tickets in Odoo, some settings must first be enabled.

First, navigate to :menuselection:`Events app --> Configuration --> Settings`. In the
:guilabel:`Registration` section, there are two different settings: :guilabel:`Tickets` and
:guilabel:`Online Ticketing`.

The :guilabel:`Tickets` setting allows users to sell event tickets with standard sales orders.

The :guilabel:`Online Ticketing` setting allows users to sell event tickets online through their
integrated Odoo website.

To activate a setting, tick the checkbox beside the desired feature's label, and click
:guilabel:`Save` to finish enabling it.

.. note::
   If these options are *not* enabled, a default :guilabel:`Register` button becomes available for
   visitors to interact with and procure free registrations to the event.

.. image:: sell_tickets/events-settings-tickets.png
   :align: center
   :alt: View of the settings page for Odoo Events.

With those settings enabled, Odoo automatically creates a new *Product Type* called, *Event Ticket*,
which is accessible on every product form. Odoo also creates three event registration products (with
the *Product Type* set to *Event Ticket*) that can be used or modified for event tickets.

.. important::
   When creating a new event registration product, the *Product Type* **must** be set to *Event
   Ticket* on the product form, in order for it to be selected in the *Product* column under the
   *Tickets* tab on an event form.

   .. image:: sell_tickets/events-tickets-registration-product.png
      :align: center
      :alt: View of an event form highlighting the column product under the tickets tab in Odoo.

.. note::
   Any event with paid tickets sold, features a :icon:`fa-dollar` :guilabel:`Sales` smart button at
   the top of the event form, where the respective sales orders attributed to those ticket sales
   become available.

   .. image:: sell_tickets/events-sales-smartbutton.png
      :align: center
      :alt: View of an event's form and the sales smart button in Odoo Events.

   Clicking the :icon:`fa-dollar` :guilabel:`Sales` smart button reveals a separate page, showcasing
   all the sales orders (standard and/or online) related to tickets that have been sold for that
   specific event.

Sell event tickets with the Sales app
=====================================

To sell event tickets with sales orders, start by navigating to the :menuselection:`Sales` app.
Then, click :guilabel:`New` to open a new quotation form.

After filling out the top portion of the form with the appropriate customer information, click
:guilabel:`Add a product` in the :guilabel:`Order Lines` tab. Then, in the :guilabel:`Product`
column, select (or create) an event registration product configured with its :guilabel:`Product
Type` set to :guilabel:`Event Ticket` on its product form.

Once an event registration product is selected, a :guilabel:`Configure an event` pop-up window
appears.

.. image:: sell_tickets/configure-event-popup.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Standard 'Configure an event' pop-up window that appears on an event ticket sales order.

From the :guilabel:`Configure an event` pop-up window, select to which event this ticket purchase is
related to in the :guilabel:`Event` field drop-down menu. Then, in the :guilabel:`Event Ticket`
drop-down menu, select which ticket tier the customer wishes to purchase, if there are multiple
tiers configured for that event.

When all the desired configurations are complete, click :guilabel:`Ok`. Doing so returns the user to
the sales order, with the event registration ticket product now present in the :guilabel:`Order
Lines` tab. The user can proceed to confirm and close the sale, per the usual process.

.. tip::
   To re-open the *Configure an event* pop-up window, hover over the event registration product name
   in the :guilabel:`Order Lines` tab, and click on the :icon:`fa-pencil` :guilabel:`(pencil)` icon.

Sell event tickets through the Website app
==========================================

When a visitor arrives on the register page of the event website, they can click the
:guilabel:`Register` button to purchase a ticket to the event.

.. note::
   If the visitor is *not* already on the register page of the event website, clicking
   :guilabel:`Register` on the event website's submenu redirects them to the proper
   register page. From there, they can click the :guilabel:`Register` button to begin the ticket
   purchasing process.

If different ticket tiers are configured for the event, the visitor is presented with a
:guilabel:`Tickets` pop-up window.

.. image:: sell_tickets/tickets-popup.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The tickets pop-up window that appears on the event's website when 'Register' is clicked.

From here, visitors select which ticket tier they would like to purchase, along with a quantity,
using the numerical drop-down menu available to the right of their desired ticket. Once the desired
selections have been entered, the visitor then clicks the :guilabel:`Register` button.

Then, an :guilabel:`Attendees` pop-up window appears, containing all the questions that have been
configured in the *Questions* tab of the event form for this particular event.

.. image:: sell_tickets/attendees-popup.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The attendees pop-up window that appears on the event's website when 'Ok' is clicked.

If multiple tickets are being purchased at once, there are numbered sections for each individual
ticket registrant, each containing the same questions. However, if any question has been configured
with the *Ask once per order* setting, that question is only asked once -- and **not** for every
attendee making the reservation in the order.

With all necessary information entered, the visitor can then click the :guilabel:`Go to Payment`
button. Doing so first takes the visitor to a :guilabel:`Billing` confirmation page, followed by a
:guilabel:`Payment` confirmation page, where they can utilize any configured payment method set up
in the database to complete the order.

Then, once the purchase is complete on the front-end of the website, the subsequent sales order is
instantly accessible in the back-end of the database.

Talks page
----------

The :guilabel:`Talks` link takes the attendee to a page filled with all the planned tracks for the
event.

.. image:: track_manage_talks/talks-page.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The Talks page on an event website built through the Odoo Events application.

At the top of :guilabel:`Talks` page, there are drop-down filter menus beside a :guilabel:`Search
a talk...` search bar.

The first drop-down filter menu (with the starting title: :guilabel:`Favorites`) is the only
drop-down filter menu that appears by default. When clicked, the resulting menu presents two
options: :guilabel:`Favorites` and :guilabel:`All Talks`.

Selecting :guilabel:`Favorites` shows *only* the tracks that have been favorited by the attendee.

.. note::
   If no tracks have been favorited, and the :guilabel:`Favorites` filter is selected, Odoo presents
   all the event tracks.

Selecting :guilabel:`All Talks` shows *all* the tracks, regardless if they have been favorited or
not.

The other drop-down filter menus that appear on this page are related to any configured tags (and
tag categories) created for event tracks in the backend.

.. tip::
   To add tags and tag categories to track forms, open a desired event track form, and start typing
   a new tag in the :guilabel:`Tags` field. Then, click :guilabel:`Create and edit...` from the
   resulting drop-down menu.

   Doing so reveals a :guilabel:`Create Tags` pop-up form.

   From here, users see the recently added tag in the :guilabel:`Tag Name` field. Beneath that,
   there is an option to add a specific :guilabel:`Color Index` to the tag for added organization.

   Lastly, there is the :guilabel:`Category` field, where users can either select a pre-existing
   category for this new tag, or create a new one.

   All options in the :guilabel:`Category` field for tags appear as their own drop-down filter menu
   on the :guilabel:`Talks` page, located on the event website.

Beneath the drop-down filter menus at the top of the :guilabel:`Talks` page, there is a list of
planned tracks for the specific event, organized by day.

If an attendee wishes to favorite a track, they can click the :icon:`fa-bell-o` :guilabel:`(empty
bell)` icon, located to the right of the track title. Attendees will know a track has been favorited
when they notice the icon has been changed to :icon:`fa-bell` :guilabel:`(filled bell)` icon.

Favoriting a track this way places it on the list of :guilabel:`Favorites`, which is accessible from
the default drop-down filter menu, located at the top of the :guilabel:`Talks` page.

Talk Proposals page
-------------------

The :guilabel:`Talk Proposals` link takes attendees to a page on the event website, wherein they can
formerly submit a proposal for a talk (:dfn:`track`) for the event, via a custom online form.

   :align: center

In addition to the form, an introduction to the page, along with any other pertinent information
related to the types of talks the event will feature can be added, if needed.

The talk proposal form can be modified in a number of different ways, via the web builder tools,
accessible by clicking :guilabel:`Edit` while on the specific page.

Then, proceed to edit any of the default fields, or add new forms with the :guilabel:`Form` building
block (located in the :guilabel:`Blocks` section of the web builder tools sidebar).

Once all the necessary information is entered into the form, the attendees just need to click the
:guilabel:`Submit Proposal` button.

Then, that talk, and all the information entered on the form, can be accessed on the
:guilabel:`Event Tracks` page for that specific event in the :guilabel:`Proposal` stage, which is
accessible via the :guilabel:`Tracks` smart button on the event form.

At that point, an internal user can review the proposed talk, and choose to accept or deny the
proposal.

If accepted, the internal user can then move the track to the next appropriate stage in the Kanban
pipeline on the :guilabel:`Event Tracks` page for the event. Then, they can open that track form,
and click the :guilabel:`Go to Website` smart button to reveal that track's page on the event
website.

From there, they can toggle the :guilabel:`Unpublished` switch in the header to
:guilabel:`Published`, which allows all event attendees to view and access the talk.

Agenda page
-----------

The :guilabel:`Agenda` link takes attendees to a page on the event website, showcasing an event
calendar, depicting when (and where) events are taking place for that specific event.

.. image:: track_manage_talks/event-agenda-page.png

Clicking any track on the calendar takes the attendee to that specific track's detail page on the
event website.

If an attendee wishes to favorite a track, they can click the :icon:`fa-bell-o` :guilabel:`(empty
bell)` icon, located to the right of the track title. Attendees will know a track has been favorited
when they notice the icon has been changed to :icon:`fa-bell` :guilabel:`(filled bell)` icon.

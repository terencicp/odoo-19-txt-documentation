Add new equipment
=================

.. _maintenance/equipment_management/add_new_equipment:

In Odoo, *equipment* refers to any item that is used in everyday operations, including the
manufacturing of products. This can mean a piece of machinery on a production line, a tool that is
used in different locations, or a computer in an office space. Equipment registered in Odoo can be
owned by the company that uses the Odoo database, or by a third party, such as a vendor in the case
of equipment rentals.

Using Odoo *Maintenance*, it is possible to track individual pieces of equipment, along with
information about their maintenance requirements. To add a new piece of equipment, navigate to the
:guilabel:`Maintenance` module, select :menuselection:`Equipments --> Machines & Tools --> Create`,
and configure the equipment as follows:

- :guilabel:`Equipment Name`: the product name of the piece of equipment
- :guilabel:`Equipment Category`: the category that the equipment belongs to; for example,
  computers, machinery, tools, etc.; new categories can be created by navigating to
  :menuselection:`Configuration --> Equipment Categories` and clicking :guilabel:`Create`
- :guilabel:`Company`: the company that owns the equipment; again, this can be the company that uses
  the Odoo database, or a third-party company
- :guilabel:`Used By`: specify if the equipment is used by a specific employee, department, or both;
  select :guilabel:`Other` to specify both an employee and a department
- :guilabel:`Maintenance Team`: the team responsible for servicing the equipment; new teams can be
  created by navigating to :menuselection:`Configuration --> Maintenance Teams` and
  selecting :guilabel:`Create`; the members of each team can also be assigned from this page
- :guilabel:`Technician`: the person responsible for servicing the equipment; this can be used to
  assign a specific individual in the event that no maintenance team is assigned or when a specific
  member of the assigned team should always be responsible for the equipment; any person added to
  Odoo as a user can be assigned as a technician
- :guilabel:`Used in location`: the location where the equipment is used; this is a simple text
  field that can be used to specify locations that are not work centers, like an office, for
  example
- :guilabel:`Work Center`: if the equipment is used at a work center, specify it here; equipment can
  also be assigned to a work center by navigating to :menuselection:`Maintenance --> Equipments -->
  Work Centers`, selecting a work center or creating a new one using the :guilabel:`Create` button,
  and clicking the :guilabel:`Equipment` tab on the work center form

.. image:: add_new_equipment/new-equipment-form.png

   :alt: An example of a fully configured new equipment form.

Include additional product information
--------------------------------------

The :guilabel:`Product Information` tab at the bottom of the page can be used to provide further
details about the piece of equipment:

- :guilabel:`Vendor`: the vendor that the equipment was purchased from
- :guilabel:`Vendor Reference`: the reference code assigned to the vendor
- :guilabel:`Model`: the specific model of the piece of equipment
- :guilabel:`Serial Number`: the unique serial number of the equipment
- :guilabel:`Effective Date`: the date that the equipment became available for use; this is used to
  calculate the :abbr:`MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures)`
- :guilabel:`Cost`: the amount the equipment was purchased for
- :guilabel:`Warranty Expiration Date`: the date on which the equipment's warranty will expire

.. image:: add_new_equipment/new-equipment-product-information.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The product information tab for the new piece of equipment.

Add maintenance details
-----------------------

The :guilabel:`Maintenance` tab at the bottom of the page provides information about the failure
frequency of the piece of equipment:

- :guilabel:`Expected Mean Time Between Failure`: the average number of days the equipment is
  expected to operate between failures. This number can be configured manually.
- :guilabel:`Mean Time Between Failure`: the average number of days the equipment operates between
  failures. This number is calculated automatically based on previous failures, and cannot
  be configured manually.
- :guilabel:`Estimated Next Failure`: the estimated date the equipment may experience its next
  failure.
  This date is calculated automatically based on the data in the :guilabel:`Mean Time Between
  Failure` and :guilabel:`Latest Failure` fields, and cannot be configured manually.
- :guilabel:`Latest Failure`: the most recent date on which the equipment failed. This date is based
  on the creation date of the equipment's most recent maintenance request, and cannot be configured
  manually.
- :guilabel:`Mean Time To Repair`: the average number of days needed to repair the equipment. This
  number is calculated automatically based on the duration of previous maintenance requests, and
  cannot be configured manually.

Maintenance calendar
====================

.. |MO| replace:: :abbr:`MO (Manufacturing Order)`

Avoiding equipment breakdowns, and blocks in warehouse work centers, requires constant equipment
maintenance. Timely corrective maintenance for machines and tools that break unexpectedly, as well
as preventive maintenance to ensure that such issues are avoided, are key to keeping warehouse
operations running smoothly.

In Odoo *Maintenance*, users can access the *Maintenance Calendar* to create, schedule, and edit
both corrective and preventive maintenance requests, to stay on top of equipment and work centers.

Create maintenance request
==========================

Maintenance requests can be created directly from the *Maintenance Calendar*. To access the
calendar, navigate to :menuselection:`Maintenance app --> Maintenance --> Maintenance Calendar`.

To create a new request, click anywhere on the calendar. Doing so opens a :guilabel:`New Event`
pop-up window. In the :guilabel:`Name:` field, assign a title to the new request.

.. image:: maintenance_calendar/maintenance-calendar-new-event-popup.png
   :align: center
   :alt: New event creation pop-up window.

Clicking :guilabel:`Create` on the pop-up window saves the new request with no additional details.
If the request's creation should be cancelled, click :guilabel:`Cancel`.

To add more details and schedule the request for a specific date and time, click :guilabel:`Edit`.

Clicking :guilabel:`Edit` opens a blank maintenance request form, where various details about the
request can be filled out.

Edit maintenance request
------------------------

In the :guilabel:`Request` field, assign a title to the new request. In the :guilabel:`Created By`
field, from the drop-down menu, select which user the request was created by. By default, this field
populates with the user actually creating the request.

.. image:: maintenance_calendar/maintenance-calendar-new-request-form.png
   :align: center
   :alt: New maintenance request form creation.

In the :guilabel:`For` field, from the drop-down menu, select if this request is being created for a
piece of :guilabel:`Equipment`, or a :guilabel:`Work Center`.

.. note::
   If :guilabel:`Work Center` is selected in the :guilabel:`For` field's drop-down menu, two
   additional fields appear on the form: :guilabel:`Work Center` and :guilabel:`Block Workcenter`.

   In the :guilabel:`Work Center` field, select which work center in the warehouse this maintenance
   request applies to.

   If the :guilabel:`Block Workcenter` option's checkbox is ticked, it is not possible to plan work
   orders, or other maintenance requests, in this work center during the time that this request is
   being performed.

If :guilabel:`Equipment` is selected in the :guilabel:`For` field, which it is by default, select
which machine or tool requires maintenance from the :guilabel:`Equipment` field. Once a specific
piece of equipment is selected, a greyed-out :guilabel:`Category` field appears, listing the
*Equipment Category* to which the equipment belongs.

In the :guilabel:`Worksheet Template` field, if necessary, click the drop-down menu to select a
worksheet template. These templates are custom templates that can be filled out by the employee
performing the maintenance.

Under the :guilabel:`Category` field, the :guilabel:`Request Date` field displays the date requested
for the maintenance to happen.

The :guilabel:`Maintenance Type` field provides two selectable radio button options:
:guilabel:`Corrective` and :guilabel:`Preventive`.

:guilabel:`Corrective` maintenance is for requests that arise for immediate needs, such as broken
equipment, while :guilabel:`Preventive` maintenance is for planned requests, to avoid breakdowns in
the future.

If this request is tied to a specific |MO|, select that |MO| from the :guilabel:`Manufacturing
Order` field.

From the drop-down menu for the :guilabel:`Team` field, select the desired maintenance team who will
perform the maintenance. In the :guilabel:`Responsible` field, select the technician responsible for
the request.

.. image:: maintenance_calendar/maintenance-calendar-filled-out-form.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Filled-out details of maintenance request form.

In the :guilabel:`Scheduled Date` field, click the date to open a calendar popover. From this
popover, select the planned date of the maintenance, and click :guilabel:`Apply` to save the date.

In the :guilabel:`Duration` field, enter the the amount of hours (in a `00:00` format) that the
maintenance is planned to take.

In the :guilabel:`Priority` field, choose a priority between one and three :guilabel:`⭐⭐⭐ (stars)`.
This indicates the importance of the maintenance request.

If working in a multi-company environment, from the drop-down menu in the :guilabel:`Company` field,
select the company to which this maintenance request belongs.

At the bottom of the form, there are two tabs: :guilabel:`Notes` and :guilabel:`Instructions`.

In the :guilabel:`Notes` tab, type out any internal notes for the team or technician assigned to the
request, if necessary.

In the :guilabel:`Instructions` tab, if necessary, select one of the three radio button options to
provide maintenance instructions to the assigned team or technician. The available methods for
providing instructions are via :guilabel:`PDF`, :guilabel:`Google Slide`, or :guilabel:`Text`.

Calendar elements
=================

The *Maintenance Calendar* provides various views, search functions, and filters to help keep track
of the progress of ongoing and planned maintenance requests.

The following sections describe elements found across various views of the calendar.

Filters and Favorites
---------------------

To access the maintenance calendar, navigate to :menuselection:`Maintenance app --> Maintenance -->
Maintenance Calendar`.

To add and remove filters for sorting data on the *Maintenance Calendar*, click the :guilabel:`🔻
(triangle pointed down)` icon, to the right of the search bar at the top of the page.

The left-hand side of the resulting drop-down menu lists all the different :guilabel:`Filters` users
can select. By default, :guilabel:`To Do` and :guilabel:`Active` are selected, so all open requests
are displayed.

.. tip::
   To add a custom filter to the :guilabel:`Maintenance Calendar`, click :guilabel:`Add Custom
   Filter`, under the :guilabel:`Filters` section of the drop-down menu. This opens an
   :guilabel:`Add Custom Filter` pop-up window.

   From this pop-up window, configure the properties of the new rule for the filter. Once ready,
   click :guilabel:`Add`.

The right-hand side of the drop-down menu lists the :guilabel:`Favorites`, or any searches that have
been saved as a favorite to be revisited at a later date.

   :align: center
   :alt: Favorites section of filters drop-down menu.

To save a new :guilabel:`Favorite` search, select the desired :guilabel:`Filters`. Then, click
:guilabel:`Save current search`. In the field directly below :guilabel:`Save current search`, assign
a name to the search.

Under the assigned name, there are two options, to save the current search either as the
:guilabel:`Default filter`, or as a :guilabel:`Shared` filter.

Selecting :guilabel:`Default filter` sets this filter as the default when opening this calendar
view.

Selecting the :guilabel:`Shared` filter makes this filter available to other users.

Once ready, click :guilabel:`Save`. When clicked, the new :guilabel:`Favorite` filter appears in the
:guilabel:`Favorites` column, and a :guilabel:`⭐ (gold star)` icon appears with the filter's name in
the search bar.

Maintenance requests
====================

.. |MO| replace:: :abbr:`MO (Manufacturing Order)`

In order to keep equipment and work centers functioning properly, it is often necessary to perform
maintenance on them. This can include preventive maintenance, intended to prevent equipment from
breaking down, or corrective maintenance, which is used to fix equipment that is broken or otherwise
unusable.

In Odoo **Maintenance**, users can create *maintenance requests* to schedule and track the progress
of equipment and work center maintenance.

Maintenance access rights
=========================

To create a maintenance request for equipment, a user has to have access to the equipment they are
submitting the request for. This can be done in one of two ways:

 - If a user is granted :guilabel:`Equipment Manager` level access rights for the **Maintenance**
   app, they have access to all of the equipment in the app. To view or edit the access rights for a
   user, navigate to :menuselection:`Settings --> Manager Users` and click a user's profile to open
   it. On the :guilabel:`Access Rights` tab, scroll to the :guilabel:`Supply Chain` section, and in
   the :guilabel:`Maintenance` field, select :guilabel:`Equipment Manager` from the drop-down menu.

   .. image:: maintenance_requests/equipment-manager.png
      :alt: The Supply Chain access rights on a user record.

 - If a user does not require full access to all equipment, they can be assigned as a *Follower* to
   one or more pieces of equipment. This allows them to create maintenance requests for that piece
   of equipment, without altering access rights. To add a user as a follower, navigate to
   :menuselection:`Maintenance --> Equipment --> Machines & Tools`, and click on a piece of
   equipment to open it. In the *chatter* for the record, click on the :icon:`fa-user`
   :guilabel:`(user)` icon to open the list of followers. Click :guilabel:`Add Followers`. On the
   :guilabel:`Add followers to this document` pop-up, select the appropriate user from the
   :guilabel:`Followers` drop-down. To send a message alerting users that they have been added as a
   follower, slide the :guilabel:`Notify Recipients` toggle to active. When finished, click
   :guilabel:`Add Followers`.

   .. image:: maintenance_requests/add-followers.png
      :alt: The followers list on an equipment record, with the add followers button highlighted.

Create maintenance request
==========================

To create a new maintenance request, navigate to :menuselection:`Maintenance app --> Maintenance -->
Maintenance Requests`, and click :guilabel:`New`.

Begin filling out the form by entering a descriptive title in the :guilabel:`Request` field (e.g.,
`Drill not working`).

The :guilabel:`Created By` field auto-populates with the user creating the request, but a different
user can be selected by clicking on the drop-down menu.

In the :guilabel:`For` drop-down menu, select :guilabel:`Equipment` if the maintenance request is
being created for a piece of equipment, or :guilabel:`Work Center` if it is being created for a work
center.

Depending on the option selected in the :guilabel:`For` field, the next field is titled either
:guilabel:`Equipment` or :guilabel:`Work Center`. Using the drop-down menu for either field, select
a piece of equipment or a work center.

If the *Custom Maintenance Worksheets* setting is enabled in the **Maintenance** app's settings, a
:guilabel:`Worksheet Template` field appears below the :guilabel:`Equipment` or :guilabel:`Work
Center` field. If necessary, use this field to select a worksheet to be filled out by the employee
performing the maintenance.

The next field is titled :guilabel:`Request Date`, and is set by default to the date on which the
maintenance request is created. This date cannot be changed by the user.

In the :guilabel:`Maintenance Type` field, select the :guilabel:`Corrective` option if the request
is intended to fix an existing issue, or the :guilabel:`Preventive` option if the request is
intended to prevent issues from occurring in the future.

If the request is being created to address an issue that arose during a specific manufacturing order
(MO), select it in the :guilabel:`Manufacturing Order` field.

If an |MO| was selected in the :guilabel:`Manufacturing Order` field, a :guilabel:`Work Order` field
appears below it. If the issue arose during a specific work order, specify it in this field.

In the :guilabel:`Team` field, select the maintenance team that is responsible for managing the
request. If a specific team member is responsible, select them in the :guilabel:`Responsible` field.

The :guilabel:`Scheduled Date` field is used to specify the date on which maintenance should take
place, and the time it should begin. Choose a date by clicking on the field to open a calendar in a
pop-up window, and then select a day on the calendar. Enter an hour and minute in the two fields
below the calendar, and click :guilabel:`Apply` to save the date and time.

The :guilabel:`Duration` field is used to specify the time it takes to complete the maintenance
request. Use the text-entry field to enter the time in a `00:00` format.

If :guilabel:`Work Center` was selected in the :guilabel:`For` field, a :guilabel:`Block Workcenter`
checkbox appears below the :guilabel:`Duration` field. Enable the checkbox to prevent work orders or
other maintenance from being scheduled at the specified work center while the maintenance request is
being processed.

The :guilabel:`Priority` field is used to communicate the importance (or urgency) of the maintenance
request. Assign the request a priority between zero and three :icon:`fa-star` :guilabel:`(star)`
icons, by clicking on the desired star number. Requests assigned a higher priority appear above
those with a lower priority, on the Kanban board used to track the progression of maintenance
requests.

In the :guilabel:`Notes` tab at the bottom of the form, enter any relevant details about the
maintenance request (why the maintenance issue arose, when it occurred, etc.).

The :guilabel:`Instructions` tab is used to include instructions for how maintenance should be
performed. Select one of the three options, and then include the instructions as detailed below:

- :guilabel:`PDF`: click the :guilabel:`Upload your file` button to open the device's file manager,
  and then select a file to upload.
- :guilabel:`Google Slide`: enter a :guilabel:`Google Slide link` in the text-entry field that
  appears after the option is selected.
- :guilabel:`Text`: enter the instructions in the text-entry field that appears after the option is
  selected.

.. image:: maintenance_requests/request-form.png
   :align: center
   :alt: A maintenance request form filled out for a piece of equipment.

Process maintenance request
===========================

Once a maintenance request has been created, it appears in the *New Request* stage of the
*Maintenance Requests* page, which can be accessed by navigating to :menuselection:`Maintenance app
--> Maintenance --> Maintenance Requests`.

Maintenance requests can be moved to different stages by dragging and dropping them. They can also
be moved by clicking on a request to open it in a new page, and then selecting the desired stage
from the stage indicator bar, located above the top-right corner of the request's form.

Successful maintenance requests should be moved to the :guilabel:`Repaired` stage, indicating that

Odoo *Maintenance* helps companies schedule corrective and preventive maintenance on equipment used
in their warehouse. This helps companies avoid equipment breakdowns, blocks in warehouse work
centers, and emergency repair costs.

Maintenance teams
=================

When creating maintenance requests, a *maintenance team* can be assigned to the request as the team
responsible for handling the request.

To view existing maintenance teams, navigate to :menuselection:`Maintenance app --> Configuration
--> Maintenance Teams`.

From the resulting :guilabel:`Teams` page, a list of all existing teams (if any) is displayed, with
the :guilabel:`Team Name`, :guilabel:`Team Members`, and :guilabel:`Company` listed in the columns,
by default.

.. image:: maintenance_setup/maintenance-setup-teams-list.png
   :align: center
   :alt: List of Teams on Maintenance Teams page.

To add a new team, click :guilabel:`New`. This adds a blank line at the bottom of the list of teams.
In the blank field that appears below the :guilabel:`Team Name` column, assign a name to the new
maintenance team.

In the :guilabel:`Team Members` column, click the field to reveal a drop-down menu with existing
users in the database. Choose which users should be members of the new maintenance team.

Click :guilabel:`Search More...` to open a :guilabel:`Search: Team Members` pop-up window to search
for users **not** shown on the initial drop-down menu.

  failure is expected. This is the **only** field not greyed-out, and the **only** field users can
  edit.
- :guilabel:`Mean Time Between Failure`: the amount of time (in days) between reported failures.
  This value is computed based on completed corrective maintenances.
- :guilabel:`Estimated Next Failure`: the date on which the next failure is expected. This date is
  computed as the Latest Failure Date + |MTBF|.
- :guilabel:`Latest Failure`: The date of the latest failure. The value in this field updates once a
  failure is reported for this equipment.
- :guilabel:`Mean Time To Repair`: the amount of time (in days) it takes to repair this equipment
  upon failure. This value updates once a maintenance request is completed for this equipment.

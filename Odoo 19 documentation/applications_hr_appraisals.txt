360 Feedback
============

Odoo's **Appraisals** app lets managers gather feedback on their direct reports from anyone in the
company. Input from colleagues gives managers a fuller view of each employee's strengths, growth
areas, and collaboration skills.

.. _appraisals/360-dashboard:

360 feedback dashboard
======================

The :guilabel:`360 Feedback` section displays information for all the surveys configured for the
**Appraisals** app. To view the surveys and their statistics, navigate to :menuselection:`Appraisals
app --> Configuration --> 360 Feedback`.

.. image:: 360/survey-list.png
   :alt: A list view of all available surveys in the Appraisals application.

Each appraisal, or survey, is presented on its own line on the :guilabel:`360 Feedback` dashboard,
along with various information related to that particular appraisal.

Each appraisal includes the following information:

- :guilabel:`Survey Name`: the name of the specific survey.
- :guilabel:`Responsible`: the employee responsible for the survey, including the month and year
  they were given that designation.
- :guilabel:`Questions`: the number of questions in that particular survey.
- :guilabel:`Average Duration`: the average time a user spends completing the survey.
- :guilabel:`Registered`: the number of people who have been sent the survey.
- :guilabel:`Completed`: the number of people who have completed the survey.
- :guilabel:`Certified`: if the survey is for a certification, the percentage of users who have
  passed the certification.

Each appraisal row offers two actions:

- :guilabel:`Test`: Opens the appraisal in a new tab to preview the questions without submitting
  answers. Close the tab to return to the list, or click :icon:`oi-arrow-right` :guilabel:`Go to
  Survey`/:guilabel:`Go to Appraisal` for the full form.
- :guilabel:`See Results`: :ref:`View response analytics <appraisals/360-view-results>`.

.. _appraisals/360-request-feedback:

Request feedback
================

To request feedback from a colleague, navigate to the **Appraisals** app, and click on the appraisal
card to open it.

Click the :guilabel:`Ask Feedback` button, and an :guilabel:`Ask Feedback` email pop-up window
appears, using the :guilabel:`Appraisal: Ask Feedback` email template.

First, using the drop-down menu, select the employees being asked to provide feedback in the
:guilabel:`Recipients` field. Multiple employees may be selected. Next, make any desired changes to
the default message, and attach any relevant documents.

The :guilabel:`Answer Deadline` date is automatically set to the day after the :guilabel:`Appraisal
Date` on the appraisal form. Using the calendar selector, modify the date, if desired.

Click :guilabel:`Send`, and the feedback requests are sent to the specified employees.

.. image:: 360/ask-feedback.png
   :alt: The email pop-up when requesting feedback from other employees.

.. _appraisals/360-view-results:

View results
============

To view the results from everyone who has completed a survey, click the :guilabel:`See Results`
button at the end of the corresponding survey line in the :ref:`360 Feedback dashboard
<appraisals/360-dashboard>`. This presents all the answers for the survey in a new tab. Each
question provides information on how many people responded to a question, and how many people
skipped it. All answers for each question are visible.

To save a PDF version of the survey results, click the :icon:`fa-print` :guilabel:`(Print)` icon at
the top of the page. To exit, close the tab.

In addition to viewing the responses from past appraisals and surveys, new surveys can also be
created from the :guilabel:`360 Feedback` page. Click the :guilabel:`New` button in the top-left of
the page to create a new survey.

For more information on how to create a survey, refer to the :doc:`../../marketing/surveys/create`
document.

==================
Appraisal analysis
==================

The **Appraisals** app has the ability to report on all the appraisals in the system, including
past, present, and future appraisals, and their respective statuses. This report helps managers
track scheduled appraisals, and identify any overdue or unconfirmed ones.

To access the *Appraisal Analysis* report, navigate to :menuselection:`Appraisals app --> Reporting
--> Appraisal Analysis`.

On the :guilabel:`Appraisal Analysis` page, a report loads, displaying all the appraisals in the
database, in a default graph chart. Appraisals are grouped by :guilabel:`Month`, then
:guilabel:`Department`.

View by status
==============

Another way to view the *Appraisal Analysis* report is in the Gantt view, which provides visual
information on the appraisal's status.

Navigate to :menuselection:`Appraisals app --> Reporting --> Appraisal Analysis`, and click the
:icon:`fa-tasks` :guilabel:`(Gantt)` icon in the upper-right corner. The report displays the current
year, grouped by department, with the current month highlighted.

Each entry is highlighted in a different color to represent their status:

+-----------+----------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| Color     | Status                     | Meaning                                        |
+===========+============================+================================================+
| Yellow    |:guilabel:`Done`            | The appraisal was completed.                   |
+-----------+----------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| Orange    |:guilabel:`Appraisal Sent`  |The appraisal was confirmed, but not completed. |
+-----------+----------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| Red       |:guilabel:`Cancelled`       |The appraisal was cancelled.                    |
+-----------+----------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| Gray      |:guilabel:`To Start`        | The appraisal was scheduled, but not confirmed.|
+-----------+----------------------------+------------------------------------------------+

.. note::
   Appraisals are scheduled automatically (appear in gray), according to their respective
   :ref:`appraisals/appraisal-plan`.

To change the period of time that is presented, adjust the date settings in the top-left corner of
the report by clicking the :icon:`fa-calendar` :guilabel:`From: (date) to (date)` to reveal a
drop-down menu of options. The options to display are :guilabel:`Today`, :guilabel:`This week`,
:guilabel:`This month`, :guilabel:`This quarter`, and :guilabel:`This year`.

Additionally, a range of dates can be entered in the :guilabel:`From` and :guilabel:`To` fields at
the bottom of the list, then click :guilabel:`Apply`.

At any point, click the :icon:`fa-crosshairs` :guilabel:`(Focus Today)` button to have the report
include today's date in the view.

To view the details of any appraisal, click on any appraisal. A pop-over window appears, displaying
the due date for the appraisal. To view more details, click the :guilabel:`View` button, and further
details appear in an :guilabel:`Open` pop-up window.

The report can have other :ref:`filters <search/filters>` and :ref:`groupings <search/group>` set in
the search bar at the top.

.. image:: appraisal_analysis/analysis.png
   :alt: A report showing all the appraisals for the Appraisal Analysis report.

.. _appraisals/group-status:

Group by status
===============

When a company has a large number of employees, the default :guilabel:`Appraisal Analysis` report
may display too much information to view at one time. In this scenario, viewing the data by status
can be beneficial.

First, clear any filters or groups from the search bar. Next, click the :icon:`fa-caret-down`
:guilabel:`(Toggle Search Panel)` icon in the far-right of the search bar. Click :guilabel:`Status`
in the :icon:`oi-group` :guilabel:`Group By` column. Click away from the drop-down menu to close it.

All the appraisals are now organized by status, in the following order: :guilabel:`Cancelled`,
:guilabel:`Done`, :guilabel:`To Start`, and :guilabel:`Appraisal Sent`.

This view shows which appraisals need to be completed, and when, as well as which appraisals still
need to be confirmed.

.. image:: appraisal_analysis/by-status.png
   :alt: A report showing all the appraisals, grouped by status.

Use case: view only the user's appraisals
=========================================

When viewing the :guilabel:`Appraisal Analysis` report, it can save time to only view the appraisals
the signed-in user is responsible for, and hide the rest.

To only view this data, click the :icon:`fa-caret-down` :guilabel:`(Toggle Search Panel)` icon in
the far-right of the search bar, revealing a drop-down menu.

.. note::
   It is not necessary to remove the default :icon:`oi-group` :guilabel:`Department` grouping. If it
   remains active, the results are grouped by department. If it is removed, the results appear in a
   list, alphabetically.

Click :guilabel:`Add Custom Filter` at the bottom of the :icon:`fa-filter` :guilabel:`Filters`
column, and a :guilabel:`Add Custom Filter` pop-up window appears.

Click into the first field, and a pop-over appears with a variety of options. Click the
:icon:`fa-chevron-right` :guilabel:`(right arrow)` icon after the word :guilabel:`Employee`, then
scroll down and click on :guilabel:`Manager`. Next, set the middle field to :guilabel:`=`
:guilabel:`(equal)`. Last, click the third field and select the desired user from the list. When all
the fields are set, click :guilabel:`Add`.

.. image:: appraisal_analysis/custom.png
   :alt: A customized filter to show only the user's employees.

Now, the only appraisals that appear are the appraisals that the selected user is responsible for,
instead of viewing *all* the appraisals.

This report can also be :ref:`grouped by status <appraisals/group-status>`.

                       :icon:`fa-star-o`

The **Appraisals** app uses a preconfigured default template, which is general enough to be
applicable to all employees. If desired, the default template :ref:`can be modified
<appraisals/modify-template>`, or, if different templates are needed, such as department-specific
appraisal templates, new templates :ref:`can be created <appraisals/create-template>`.

.. _appraisals/modify-template:

Modify appraisal templates
==========================

If needed, changes can be made to the default template. To view the default template, navigate to
:menuselection:`Appraisals app --> Configuration --> Appraisal Templates`.

The default template appears in a list view, named :guilabel:`Default Template`. Click on the
template to view the template details. Make any desired changes to the template.

The default template consists of the following questions:

.. list-table:: Odoo **Appraisals** default appraisal template
   :header-rows: 1

   * - **Employee Feedback**
     - **Manager Feedback**


   * - **My work**

.. _appraisals/create-template:

Create appraisal templates
==========================

Large companies with many departments may prefer department-specific appraisal templates, instead of
using a default universal template. Creating and using department-specific templates can be helpful
if specific feedback is needed.

.. example::
   An appliance repair company has two main types of employees, office workers who handle
   administrative tasks and scheduling, and repair technicians who work in the field, performing
   repairs at customers' homes.

   This type of company may create two different appraisal templates, one for the office workers,
   and one for the on-site repair technicians.

To create a new appraisal template, click the :guilabel:`New` button in the upper-left corner. Next,
:doc:`configure the appraisal <../../marketing/surveys/create>` by adding questions to the template.

Additionally, a new appraisal template can be created by duplicating the default template, and
making modifications to the copy. To duplicate the template, navigate to :menuselection:`Appraisals
app --> Configuration --> Appraisal Templates`, then click on the template being duplicated. Click
the :icon:`fa-gear` :guilabel:`(Actions)` icon, then click :icon:`fa-clone` :guilabel:`Duplicate`.

First, change the name of the template, then make any desired changes to the template.

.. important::
   Appraisal templates are housed in the **Surveys** app. Any appraisal template created *in* the
   **Appraisals** app must be configured to be used with the **Appraisals** app, or it will *not* be
   available for appraisals.

   To ensure a new template is available for the **Appraisals** app, navigate to the **Surveys**
   app, and click on the appraisal template.

   Tick the radio button next to :guilabel:`Appraisal` at the top of the survey. This setting allows
   the survey to be used in the **Appraisals** app, and is visible in the :guilabel:`Appraisal
   Template` drop-down menu.

=====
Goals
=====

The Odoo **Appraisals** application allows managers to set (and track) clear goals for their
employees. Continuous progress towards goals give employees a concrete target between reviews, and
give managers reliable insights when evaluating performance.

View goals
==========

To view all goals, navigate to :menuselection:`Appraisals app --> Goals`. This presents all the
goals for every employee, in a default list view, grouped by :guilabel:`Employee`.

Click on an employee to expand the listed goals. Each goal displays the following information:

- :guilabel:`Name`: The name of the goal.
- :guilabel:`Created on`: The date the goal was made.
- :guilabel:`Progress`: The percentage of progress the employee has achieved.
- :guilabel:`Employee`: The employee assigned to the goal.

.. note::
   Only employees with goals assigned to them appear in the list.

.. image:: goals/goal-list.png
   :alt: A list of goals for all employees.

.. _appraisals/goal-card:

Create goals
============

To create new goals, navigate to :menuselection:`Appraisals app --> Goals`, and click
:guilabel:`New` in the top-left corner to open a blank goal form. Add the following information on
the form:

- :guilabel:`Goal`: Type in a brief name for the goal in this field.
- :guilabel:`Employee`: Using the drop-down menu, select the employee being assigned the goal. Once
  this field is populated, the employee's manager populates the :guilabel:`Manager` field.
- :guilabel:`Progress`: Click the current percentage of competency for the goal. The options are
  :guilabel:`0%`, :guilabel:`25%`, :guilabel:`50%`, :guilabel:`75%`, or :guilabel:`100%`.
- :guilabel:`Manager`: Using the drop-down menu, select the employee's manager (if not already
  selected).
- :guilabel:`Deadline`: Using the calendar selector, enter the due date for the goal.
- :guilabel:`Tags`: Using the drop-down menu, add any relevant :ref:`tags <appraisals/add-tags>` to
  the goal.
- :guilabel:`Description` tab: Enter any details regarding the goal in this tab.

.. tip::
   Some goals can be broken down into steps, which may be input as a checklist. A checklist is a
   tool the employee may use to mark their progress.

.. image:: goals/new-goal.png
   :alt: A completed goal created for learning Python.

.. _appraisals/add-tags:

Tags
----

Adding tags to goals can help when viewing the goals report, to see how many goals with specific
tags are assigned to employees.

To view all the current tags, and add new ones, navigate to :menuselection:`Appraisals app -->
Configuration --> Tags`. All tags appear in a list view. The default tags are: :guilabel:`External`,
:guilabel:`Hard Skills`, :guilabel:`Internal`, :guilabel:`Programming`, :guilabel:`Soft Skills`, and
:guilabel:`Training`.

To add a new tag, click the :guilabel:`New` button in the upper-left corner, and a new line appears
at the bottom of the list. Enter the tag, then press return or click away from the field.

Update goals
============

During employee appraisals, goals are reviewed to see how much progress the employee has made. When
an employee has achieved the next level of progress, the goal must be updated accordingly.

To update a goal's progress percentage, navigate to :menuselection:`Appraisals app --> Goals`.
Expand the employee whose goals are being evaluated, and click on an individual goal to open the
goal record.

Click the new :guilabel:`Progress` box to set the new progress level. It is recommended to add notes
in the :guilabel:`Description` tab, as the employee progresses with the goal. The notes should
include dates the progress changed, and any supporting information regarding the change.

.. note::
   Goal progress can be updated at any time by the employee's manager, not only during an appraisal.

Complete goals
==============

When a goal has been met, it is important to update the record. Navigate to
:menuselection:`Appraisals app --> Goals`. Expand the employee whose goals are being evaluated, and
click on an individual goal to open the goal record.

Click the :guilabel:`Mark as Done` button in the upper-left corner. A green :guilabel:`Done` banner
appears in the top-right corner of the goal card, and the :guilabel:`Progress` changes to
:guilabel:`100%`.

.. note::
   On the :guilabel:`Goals` dashboard, completed goals are indicated with a green :guilabel:`100%`
   in the :guilabel:`Progress` column.

==================================================

==================
Conduct appraisals
==================

This guide explains the end-to-end appraisal workflow in Odoo, from creation to final rating,
showing how managers and employees collaborate at each stage.

- :ref:`Employee self-assessment <appraisals/employee-feedback>`: The employee completes the
  Employee's Feedback template and updates their skills. Responses remain hidden until the employee
  sets the form to *Visible to Manager*.
- :ref:`Manager feedback <appraisals/manager-feedback>`: While the employee works on their section,
  the manager reviews goals, gathers peer input if needed, and fills out the *Manager's Feedback*
  template. Feedback can remain hidden until the appraisal meeting.
- :ref:`Appraisal review <appraisals/review>`: Manager and employee meet to discuss both feedback
  sections, validate skill changes, and agree on next steps. The meeting can be scheduled directly
  from the appraisal or the calendar.
- :ref:`Completion and rating <appraisals/complete>`: After the discussion, the manager assigns a
  final rating, adds any private notes, and marks the appraisal Done. The record then locks unless
  it is reopened for further edits.

Throughout the process, optional actions, such as requesting peer feedback or logging private
manager notes, enhance the appraisal's accuracy and relevance.

.. _appraisals/employee-feedback:

Employee self-assessment
========================

Once an appraisal is confirmed, the employee is required to fill out the self-assessment.

.. note::
   Only confirmed appraisals can be worked on. If an appraisal is *not* confirmed, the fields on the
   appraisal form cannot be edited, and feedback cannot be recorded.

After the employee receives a notification via email that an appraisal is confirmed and scheduled,
they are requested to fill out their half of the default appraisal template, and update any skills.

Employee's can click on the link in the confirmation email to navigate to the appraisal, or they
can open their appraisal in the **Appraisals** app. To do this, open the **Appraisals** app, then
click on the appraisal card.

The :guilabel:`Employee's Feedback` half of the template includes the following sections:
:guilabel:`My work`, :guilabel:`My future`, and :guilabel:`My feelings`. Each of these sections
consists of several questions for the employee to answer, allowing the employee to perform a
self-assessment, and provide feedback on how they feel about the company and their role.

Employee skills
---------------

After completing the :ref:`Employee's Feedback <appraisals/employee-feedback>` section in the
:guilabel:`Appraisal` tab, the employee next updates their skills in the :guilabel:`Skills` tab.

Any skills that were present on the employee's record when the appraisal was confirmed, appear in
this tab. If a :guilabel:`Skill Level` has changed since the last appraisal, the level must be
updated.

.. note::
   The :guilabel:`Skills` tab does not appear on the appraisal until the appraisal is confirmed.

Click on the :guilabel:`Skill Level` for the skill that has changed, revealing a drop-down of all
available levels. Click on the new level for the skill. Once selected, the :guilabel:`Progress`
field updates accordingly. Next, click into the :guilabel:`Justification` field for the skill, and
enter any relevant details explaining the change. This field is not necessary, but may aid
management when reviewing the employee's skills.

Complete the self-assessment
----------------------------

The employee feedback remains hidden from management while the employee is performing their
self-assessment. Once the employee has completed their half of the appraisal, and updated any
skills, they tick the gray :guilabel:`Not Visible to Manager` toggle. This changes the toggle text
to :guilabel:`Visible to Manager`, the color changes to green, and their responses are then visible
to management.

Additionally, a green dot appears on the appraisal card on the **Appraisals** app dashboard,
indicating the employee has completed their assessment, and marked their half of the appraisal as
done.

.. _appraisals/manager-feedback:

Manager feedback
================

While the employee is completing their :guilabel:`Employee's Feedback` section, the manager fills
out the :guilabel:`Manager's Feedback` section.

Before the manager fills out their portion of the appraisal, managers typically review the
employee's goals and skills, and ask for :ref:`additional feedback <appraisals/ask-feedback>` from
the employee's coworkers, to better understand all the achievements and challenges for the employee.

Once the manager has all the information they need to evaluate the employee, they fill out the
:guilabel:`Manager's Feedback` section of the appraisal form. The manager's half has the following
sections: :guilabel:`Feedback`, :guilabel:`Evaluation`, and :guilabel:`Improvements`.

The manager's appraisal focuses on the employee's accomplishments, as well as identifying areas of
improvements, with actionable steps to help the employee achieve their goals in both the long and
short term.

When the feedback section is completed, the manager can tick the :guilabel:`Not Visible to Employee`
toggle. This changes the toggle text to :guilabel:`Visible to Employee`, the color changes to green,
and their responses are then visible to the employee.

.. note::
   Some managers prefer to keep their feedback hidden from the employee until they :ref:`meet with
   the employee <appraisals/review>` to discuss the appraisal.

.. _appraisals/ask-feedback:

Ask for feedback
----------------

As part of the appraisal process, the manager can :ref:`request feedback for an employee
<appraisals/360-request-feedback>`  from anyone in the company about an employee. In Odoo, this is
referred to as *360 Feedback*.

Feedback is requested from coworkers and anyone else who works with the employee. This is to get a
more well-rounded view of the employee, and aid in the manager's overall assessment.

.. important::
   To request feedback, the appraisal **must** be confirmed. Once confirmed, an :guilabel:`Ask
   Feedback` button appears in the upper-left corner of the form.

.. _appraisals/review:

Appraisal review
================

Once both portions of an appraisal are completed (the :ref:`employee <appraisals/employee-feedback>`
and :ref:`manager <appraisals/manager-feedback>` feedback sections), it is time for the employee and
manager to :ref:`meet and discuss the appraisal <appraisals/schedule>`.

During the appraisal meeting, the manager reviews both the :ref:`Employee's Feedback
<appraisals/employee-feedback>` section as well as their own :ref:`Manager feedback
<appraisals/manager-feedback>`.

Additionally, the employee's :ref:`skills <appraisals/skills>` and :doc:`goals <goals>`
are reviewed at this time, and updated as needed.

.. _appraisals/schedule:

Schedule appraisal review
-------------------------

A meeting can be scheduled in one of two ways: either from the **Appraisals** app dashboard, or from
an individual appraisal card.

To schedule an appraisal from the dashboard of the **Appraisals** app, first navigate to
:menuselection:`Appraisals app --> Appraisals`.

Click the activity icon beneath the appraisal date on the desired appraisal card, and an activity
pop-up window appears. Click :icon:`fa-plus` :guilabel:`Schedule an activity`, and set the
:guilabel:`Activity Type`` to :guilabel:`Meeting`. For more information on scheduling activities,
refer to the :ref:`activities documentation <activities/all>`.

Doing so opens a :guilabel:`New Event` pop-up form. From this pop-up form, make any desired
modifications, such as designating a :guilabel:`Start` time.

The employee populates the :guilabel:`Attendees` section by default. Add anyone else who should be
in the meeting, if necessary.

To make the meeting a video call, instead of an in-person meeting, click :icon:`fa-plus`
:guilabel:`Odoo meeting`, and a :guilabel:`Videocall URL` link appears in the field.

Once all the desired changes are complete, click :guilabel:`Save & Close`.

The meeting now appears on the calendar, and the invited parties are informed, via email.

.. image:: new_appraisals/meeting.png
   :alt: The meeting form with all information entered for Ronnie Hart's annual appraisal.

The other way to schedule a meeting is from the individual appraisal form. To do this, navigate to
the :menuselection:`Appraisal app` dashboard, then click on an appraisal card.

Next, click on the :icon:`fa-calendar` :guilabel:`Meeting` smart button, and the calendar loads.
Follow the same directions above to create the meeting.

For more detailed information on how to schedule activities, refer to the :doc:`activities
<../../essentials/activities>` documentation.

.. note::
   If no meetings are scheduled, the :guilabel:`Meeting` smart button reads :guilabel:`No Meeting`.

.. _appraisals/skills:

Review employee skills
----------------------

Part of an appraisal is evaluating an employee's skills, and tracking their progress over time. The
:guilabel:`Skills` tab of the appraisal form auto-populates with the skills from the :ref:`employee
form <employees/skills>`, once an appraisal is confirmed.

Each skill is grouped with like skills, and the :guilabel:`Skill Level`, :guilabel:`Progress`, and
:guilabel:`Justification` are displayed for each skill.

:ref:`Update any skills, or add any new skills <employees/skills>` to the :guilabel:`Skills` tab.

If a skill level has increased, enter a reason for the improved rating in the
:guilabel:`Justification` field, such as `took a fluency language test` or `received Javascript
certification`.

After an appraisal is completed, and the skills have been updated, the next time an appraisal is
confirmed, the updated skills populate the :guilabel:`Skills` tab.

.. note::
   The :guilabel:`Skills` tab *can* be modified **after** the employee and their manager have met
   and discussed the employee's appraisal.

   This is a common situation as the manager may not have all the necessary information to assess
   and update the employee's skills before meeting.

.. _appraisals/complete:

Complete an appraisal
=====================

After the appraisal has been filled out by both the employee and the manager, and both parties have
met and discussed the employee's performance, the manager then :ref:`logs any notes
<appraisals/notes>`, and :ref:`assigns a rating <appraisals/rate>`.

When completed, click the :guilabel:`Mark as Done` button in the upper-left corner of the appraisal
form.

Once the appraisal is marked as *Done*, the status changes from :guilabel:`Confirmed` to
:guilabel:`Done`, and the :guilabel:`Mark as Done` button changes to a :guilabel:`Reopen` button.

.. tip::
   Modifications are **not** possible once the appraisal is marked as done.

   To make any changes to an appraisal with a status of :guilabel:`Done`, click the
   :guilabel:`Reopen` button, then, click :guilabel:`Confirm`, and make any modifications needed.
   Once all modifications are complete, click the :guilabel:`Mark as Done` button again.

.. _appraisals/notes:

Add a private note
------------------

Managers can log notes on an appraisal that are **only** visible to other managers. Enter any notes
in the :guilabel:`Private Note` tab. This can be done anytime during the appraisal process.

The employee being evaluated does **not** have access to this tab, and the tab does **not** appear
on their appraisal.

The tab is optional and does not affect the final rating.

.. _appraisals/rate:

Provide a final rating
----------------------

After both the manager and employee have met to discuss the employee's performance, the appraisal
must be given a :guilabel:`Final Rating`.

Using the drop-down menu, select the rating for the employee. The default options are:
:guilabel:`Needs improvement`, :guilabel:`Meets expectations`, :guilabel:`Exceeds expectations`,
:guilabel:`Strongly Exceeds Expectations`, and :guilabel:`Good`.

To add a new rating, navigate to :menuselection:`Appraisals app --> Configuration --> Evaluation
Scale`. The default ratings are presented in a list view. To add a new rating, click the
:guilabel:`New` button in the upper-left corner, and a blank line appears at the bottom of the list.
Enter the new rating, then press the enter key, or click away from the line. Add as many new ratings
as needed.

Click :menuselection:`Appraisals` in the top menu to return to the :guilabel:`Appraisals` dashboard,
click on the appraisal, then select the desired :guilabel:`Final Rating`.

Schedule appraisals
===================

Odoo's **Appraisals** app helps managers run recurring performance reviews. Each review can include
a self-assessment and can follow any schedule the company sets.

Regular appraisals turn day-to-day work into clear goals and measurable skill targets. They also
supply the objective evidence HR needs for raises or promotions, and keep individual performance
aligned with company KPIs.

Reviews can be :ref:`scheduled automatically <appraisals/auto>` through an :ref:`appraisal plan
<appraisals/appraisal-plan>` that triggers evaluations at set intervals, or :ref:`created manually
<appraisals/manual>` whenever needed—such as before a promotion or department transfer.

.. _appraisals/auto:

Automatic scheduling
====================

To ensure no appraisal is missed, enable automatic scheduling by going to :menuselection:`Appraisals
app --> Configuration --> Settings`.

The :guilabel:`Appraisals Plan` settings determines the frequency that appraisals are scheduled.

.. image:: schedule_appraisals/appraisals-setting.png
   :alt: The appraisals sections with the timeline filled in and 360 feedback enabled.

.. _appraisals/appraisal-plan:

Appraisals plans
----------------

By default, appraisals are preconfigured to be automatically created six months after an employee is
hired, with a second appraisal exactly six months after that.

Once those two initial appraisals have been completed in the employee's first year, following
appraisals are only created once a year (every twelve months).

To modify this schedule, change the number of months in the blank fields under the
:guilabel:`Appraisals Plans` section.

.. important::
   Changing the :guilabel:`Appraisals Plans` field updates **every** employee record whose
   :guilabel:`Next Appraisal Dates` is empty.

Appraisals automation
---------------------

Tick the checkbox next to :guilabel:`Appraisals Automation` to have Odoo automatically schedule
*and* confirm appraisals.

Appraisals are scheduled according to the :ref:`appraisal plan <appraisals/appraisal-plan>`.

.. _appraisals/manual:

Manually schedule an appraisal
==============================

Managers can schedule an appraisal at any time, outside the regular cycle.

For example, if an employee is promoted, or transfers to a new role or a new department, an
appraisal is scheduled to assess performance in the current role.

To create a new appraisal, open the :menuselection:`Appraisals` app, and click the :guilabel:`New`
button in the upper-left corner. This opens a blank :guilabel:`Appraisals` form.

First, using the drop-down menu, select the employee being evaluated, in the first field on the
form. Once an employee is selected, the employee's :guilabel:`Manager`, :guilabel:`Job Position`,
and :guilabel:`Department` fields are populated according to the information on the employee record.

The current date populates the :guilabel:`Appraisal Date` field, which is the date the appraisal is
scheduled to be completed. Using the calendar selector, adjust the date, if desired. This field is
typically updated when the manager submits their final rating at the end of the appraisal process.

If there is an :ref:`appraisal plan <appraisals/appraisal-plan>` configured, the :guilabel:`Next
Appraisal Date` field displays :guilabel:`Ongoing`. This indicates that the following appraisal will
be scheduled according to the appraisal schedule. Once the appraisal is marked as complete, the
:guilabel:`Next Appraisal Date` is updated with the date of the next appraisal.

Last, select the desired :guilabel:`Appraisal Template`. The :guilabel:`Default Template` populates
this field, by default, and is created when the **Appraisals** app is installed. Using the drop-down
menu, select a different template, if desired.

Once the information in the top-half of the :guilabel:`Appraisals` form is complete, click the
:guilabel:`Confirm` button in the upper-left corner, and the appraisal is scheduled, and the
employee is notified.

Once the appraisal is confirmed, both the employee and manager can start to fill out the appraisal.

Skills evolution
================

In Odoo's **Appraisals** app, it is possible to view employee's skills as they progress over time in
the :ref:`Skills Evolution <appraisals/identify-skills-evolution>` report, also known as the
*Appraisal Skills Report*.

Managers can use this to see who is achieving their various skill goals set on their appraisals, who
is meeting their skill deadlines, who has the highest performance in terms of skill development, and
more.

The *Skills Evolution* report also provides the ability to :ref:`search for employees with specific
skills <appraisals/identify-skills>` at certain levels, which can be helpful for scenarios where
specific skills are required.

.. _appraisals/identify-skills-evolution:

Skills evolution report
=======================

To access this *Skills Evolution* report, navigate to :menuselection:`Appraisals app --> Reporting
--> Skills Evolution`.

Doing so reveals the :guilabel:`Appraisal Skills Report` page. All skills are grouped by the month
they were created, then by employee, and then by skill type.

.. important::
    The :guilabel:`Appraisals Skills Report` only displays skills for employees with at least one
    completed appraisal. Skills for employees whose appraisals are still draft or pending are not
    included.

   When an employee completes their first appraisal, all their skills appear on the report. Once
   subsequent appraisals are marked as done, any skill changes from the previous appraisal appear on
   the report.

   Any skill level changes from ongoing appraisals that have **not** been finalized are **not**
   included in this report.

To view the specific details for an employee's skill types, expand the :guilabel:`Employee`, then
expand the individual :guilabel:`Skill Types`. Each skill type displays the following information:

- :guilabel:`Employee`: the name of the employee.
- :guilabel:`Skill Type`: the category the skill falls under.
- :guilabel:`Skill`: the specific, individual skill.
- :guilabel:`Current Level`: the current level the employee has achieved for the skill.
- :guilabel:`Previous Progress`: the previous percentage of competency achieved for the skill.
- :guilabel:`Current Progress`: the current percentage of competency achieved for the skill.
- :guilabel:`Justification`: any notes entered on the skill, explaining the progress.

The color of the skill text indicates any changes from the previous appraisal. Skill levels that
have increased since the last appraisal appear in green, as an *Improvement*. Skill levels that have
**not** changed appear in black, as *No Change*. Skills that have regressed appear in red, as
*Regression*.

This report can be modified to find specific information by adjusting the :ref:`filters
<search/filters>` and :ref:`groupings <search/group>` set in the search bar at the top.

.. image:: skills_evolution/skills-report.png
   :alt: A report showing all the skills grouped by employee.

.. _appraisals/identify-skills:

Use case: Identify employees with specific skills
=================================================

Since the :guilabel:`Appraisal Skills Report` organizes all skills by month, then employee, it can
be difficult to find employees with a specific skill at a specific level. To find these employees, a
custom filter must be used.

In this example, the report is modified to show employees with an expert level of Javascript
knowledge. To view only those employees, first remove all active filters in the search bar.

Next, click the :icon:`fa-caret-down` :guilabel:`(Toggle Search Panel)` icon in the search bar, then
click :guilabel:`Add Custom Filter` beneath the :icon:`fa-filters` :guilabel:`Filters` column to
load an :guilabel:`Add Custom Filter` pop-up window.

Using the drop-down menu in the first field, select :guilabel:`Skill`. Then, keep the second field
as-is (:guilabel:`is in)`, and select :guilabel:`Javascript` from the third drop-down menu in the
third field.

Next, click :guilabel:`New Rule`, and another line appears. In this second line, select
:guilabel:`Current Level` for the first drop-down field, leave the second field as-is :guilabel:`(is
in)`, then select :guilabel:`Expert` for the third drop-down field.

After the second rule is added, navigate to the text at the top of the pop-up window that shows
:guilabel:`Match any` :icon:`fa-caret-down` :guilabel:`of the following rules`. Click the drop-down
menu for :guilabel:`any` and change it to :guilabel:`all`.

Finally, click the :guilabel:`Add` button.

.. image:: skills_evolution/javascript.png
   :alt: The Custom Filter pop-up with the parameters set.

Now, only employees that have an :guilabel:`Expert` level for the skill :guilabel:`Javascript`
appear. In this example, only :guilabel:`Marc Demo` meets these criteria.

.. image:: skills_evolution/results.png
   :alt: The employees with expert Javascript skills.

Use case: Assess highest improvement
====================================

Another way to modify the :guilabel:`Appraisal Skills Report` is to identify the employee who has
the highest amount of improved skills over a specific period of time.

To view this information, first remove the default filter in the search bar. Next, click the
:icon:`fa-caret-down` :guilabel:`(Toggle Search Panel)` icon in the search bar, then click
:guilabel:`Improvement` beneath the :icon:`fa-filter` :guilabel:`Filters` column. Enabling this
filter only presents skills that have improved.

It is possible to view the skills that have improved over a period of time, such as a specific
quarter, or month. With the search bar drop-down menu still expanded, click :guilabel:`Add Custom
Filter` at the bottom of the :icon:`fa-filter` :guilabel:`Filters` column, and an :guilabel:`Add
Custom Filter` pop-up window appears.

Select :guilabel:`Create Date` for the first drop-down field, then select :guilabel:`is between` for
the second drop-down field. Once :guilabel:`is between` is selected, a second field appears after
the last field. Using the calendar selector, select the date range to apply the filter to. Once all
the fields are properly formatted, click :guilabel:`Add`.

The custom filter presents all skills that have been improved, organized by employee, in a default
list view.

.. example::
   To determine the employee with the most amount of improved skills for the second quarter, remove
   the default filter in the search bar of the :guilabel:`Appraisal Skills Report`. Next, activate
   the :guilabel:`Improvement` filter, then click :guilabel:`Add Custom Filter` at the bottom of the
   :icon:`fa-filter` :guilabel:`Filters` column.

   In the resulting :guilabel:`Add Custom Filter` pop-up window, select :guilabel:`Create Date` for
   the first drop-down field, then select :guilabel:`is between` for the second drop-down field. Two
   date fields appear after :guilabel:`is between` is selected.

   Using the calendar selector, set the first date to :guilabel:`04/01/2025` and the second date to
   :guilabel:`06/30/2025`, then click :guilabel:`Add`.

   .. image:: skills_evolution/custom-filter.png
      :alt: The Custom Filter pop-up with the parameters set.

To view the number of employees and skills in further detail, click the :icon:`oi-view-pivot`
:guilabel:`(Pivot)` icon in the top-right corner to view the data in a pivot table. This presents a
pivot table with the employees populating the rows, and the only visible column represents the total
number of improved skills.

To expand the columns to view which skill types had the most overall improvement, click
:icon:`fa-plus-square` :guilabel:`Total` above the :guilabel:`Count` column, then click
:guilabel:`Add Custom Group` :icon:`fa-caret-down`, then click :guilabel:`Skill` from the resulting
drop-down menu. This expands all the improved skills, organized by individual skill.

.. example::
   In this example, :guilabel:`Audrey Peterson` improved the most in the third quarter, with five
   improved skills.

  .. image:: skills_evolution/largest-improvement.png
     :alt: The pivot table showing the skill improvements for the third quarter.

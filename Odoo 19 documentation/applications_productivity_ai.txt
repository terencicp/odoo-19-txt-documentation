.. |AI| replace:: :abbr:`AI (artificial intelligence)`

Artificial intelligence (AI) in Odoo enhances productivity across all apps by providing intelligent,
context-aware assistance. It helps users work faster, make better decisions, and automate routine
tasks, all while staying within the familiar Odoo interface.

Ask AI
======

The :guilabel:`Ask AI` feature allows users to receive assistance anywhere in an Odoo database. It
understands natural language and can answer questions, open views, and improve content.

To enter a prompt from anywhere in the database, enter :kbd:`Ctrl` + :kbd:`k` to open the command
palette. From here, type in a prompt, then click the |AI| icon or hit enter. This opens a
conversation window with the *Ask AI* agent.

.. image:: ai/command-palatte.png
   :alt: An open command palatte with a prompt.

.. important::
   The *Ask AI* agent is instructed not to display an error to a user. If it is unable to complete
   the requested query, it responds that it is unable to complete the request at that time.

After the agent has responded, hover over the response to do one of the following:

 - :guilabel:`Send as Message`: opens an email pop-up with the contents of the response in the body
   of the message. The message can be edited before it is sent.
 - :guilabel:`Log as Note`: opens a chatter pop-up with the contents of the response. The note can
   be edited before it is logged as a note.
 - :icon:`fa-copy` :guilabel:`(Copy)`: copies the contents of the response to the clipboard.

 .. image:: ai/response-options.png
    :alt: A response from an agent with the send, log, and copy options visible.

.. note::
   These options are pre-configured *Default Prompts*. The default prompts can be edited, and new
   prompts can be added through the **AI** application.

.. tip::
   To open the conversation with the agent in the **Discuss** app, click on the header of the
   conversation window, then click :icon:`fa-expand` :guilabel:`Open in Discuss`.

   .. image:: ai/open-in-discuss.png
      :alt: The header of a conversation window with the open in discuss option visible.

AI button
---------

In addition to the command palette, the |AI| button can be utilized to open a conversation with the
*Ask AI* agent as well. The |AI| button is located in the top-right corner of the screen and is
available throughout the database regardless of what app the user is currently using.

After clicking the |AI| button, a conversation window opens with the *Ask AI* agent. Either type a
request in the message field or click one of the preconfigured message prompts.

.. figure:: ai/ai-button.png
   :alt: The AI button opens a window that includes suggested conversation prompts.

   The AI button opens a window that includes suggested conversation prompts. The prompts vary based
   on where in the database the button was clicked.

Common requests
===============

Below are some common requests that the *Ask AI* agent can assist with:

- Translation: *Translate the most recent chatter message*
- Summarize: *Summarize this chatter thread*
- Text generation: *Generate a follow-up message*
- Improve: *Improve this message draft*
- Suggest: *Suggest next steps for the sales rep/support agent*

.. important::
   The standard *Ask AI* agent **cannot** make changes to the database. As such, it can open views
   and display reports, but it cannot create leads or alter data. For more information on
   customizing agents to complete tasks, see :ref:`Topics <ai/topics>`.

AI agents
=========

An AI agent is a smart assistant in Odoo that can understand natural language, perform tasks, and
assist users by interacting with Odoo tools. Agents are a core component of the AI structure in
Odoo. Each agent has a defined purpose, prompt, and a set of topics and tools that guide its
behavior.

Agents are formed of two main components, *Topics* and *Sources*.

 - *Topics* are the instructions and roles that inform the agent of what tasks they need to
   complete. *Tools* are assigned to topics, and are the actual functions the agent can utilize to
   perform tasks.
 - *Sources* provide the agent with the information they need to complete their tasks.

.. important::
   While many AI features can be used in Odoo without the **AI** application, creating and
   customizing agents requires that the **AI** application is installed.

.. _ai/agents/prompts-in-odoo:

AI prompts in Odoo
==================

Before working with AI agents, it is important to understand some basics concepts regarding AI
prompts.

An AI prompt is a set of written instructions or context given to an AI model that tells it how to
respond to a request, or what role to take. Prompts can define:

- the tone, style, and persona of the AI model
- the scope of what the model can do
- the type of output expected from the request

In Odoo, each AI agent is assigned a :guilabel:`System Prompt`, which defines the agent's overall
role, purpose, and behavior. It acts as the core mission statement of the agent, and drives all
interactions.

Each :ref:`Topic <ai/topics>` also includes its own prompt-like component, called
:guilabel:`Instructions`. Instructions are topic-specific guidelines that refine how the agent
behaves within a certain context or workflow, and how it interacts within the Odoo framework.

Instructions often include:

- A purpose, or what the topic covers
- Rules or constraints for the agent to follow when assigned this topic
- Step-by-step workflows for how to complete a specific action
- Technical details needed to complete any actions

Agent structure
===============

.. _ai/topics:

Topics
------

*Topics* are a collection of instructions and :ref:`tools <ai/tools>` that define how an agent
behaves within a specific context. Essentially, the topics define what an agent can do within the
database. Topics guide conversations, telling the agent what it can do, how it can do it, and when
it should do it.

.. important::
   If an agent is not assigned any Topics, it is only able to provide information, not complete
   tasks or make changes to the database.

Within each topic includes a detailed prompt, which provides the agent with more in-depth
instructions on how to perform the tasks associated with that topic, define the boundaries of its
behavior, and determine how it should interpret user intent. These prompts ensure that the agent
follows a consistent reasoning pattern and uses the appropriate tools to generate accurate,
context-aware responses.

The following topics are preconfigured in the **AI** app:

- :guilabel:`Natural Language Search`: supports the interpretation of a user query to open the
  appropriate Odoo view with a set of tools necessary to perform the search.
- :guilabel:`Information retrieval`: a collection of tools to retrieve information about the models.
- :guilabel:`Create Leads`: a collection of tools to support automated lead creation. This topic is
  **only** available if the **CRM** app is installed.

Within each topic is a set of :guilabel:`Instructions`, which act as a prompt and provide guidance
for the structure of the interaction, and one or more :ref:`AI Tools <ai/tools>`, which indicate the
functions the agent can perform.

.. _ai/tools:

Tools
~~~~~

*Tools* are the functions the agent can perform in Odoo. These include actions like creating a lead
or opening a view. Tools extend the purpose of the agent beyond conversations, they enable real
actions. The available tools in a database vary based on the applications installed. Multiple
:guilabel:`AI Tools` can be assigned to a single topic.

Sources
-------

Sources are the data the agent can refer to when generating responses or completing tasks. Sources
are indexed so the agent can retrieve relevant information when a user asks a question.

.. example::
    An agent designed to answer customer support questions has **Knowledge** articles included as
    sources, which include frequently asked questions.

Sources can be in the following formats:

 - PDFs
 - Weblinks
 - Documents (uploaded in the **Documents** application)
 - **Knowledge** app articles

.. important::
   If the :guilabel:`Restrict to Sources` option is enabled on an agent, the agent can **only**
   utilize information from the uploaded and active sources.

Create a new agent
==================

To create a new AI agent, navigate to the :menuselection:`AI app --> New`. Enter an :guilabel:`Agent
Name`, then add a short description, if desired.

.. tip::
   Before creating a new agent, it is recommended to have a clear use case in mind. This helps when
   writing out the :guilabel:`System Prompt`, and assigning the :guilabel:`Topics` and :guilabel:`AI
   Tools`.

Select an :guilabel:`LLM Model` from the drop-down menu.

.. important::
   Odoo supports multiple versions of both ChatGPT and Gemini.

Next, select a :guilabel:`Response Style`. This manages the overall tone the agent uses when
responding to an inquiry. Choose from one of the following options:

 - :guilabel:`Analytical`: more mathematical, this option is more likely to give the same answer to
   the same question. This option is recommended for situations where accuracy is more important
   than diplomacy.
 - :guilabel:`Balanced`: a mix of both *Analytical* and *Creative*. This is an excellent option for
   situations with outside customers who would benefit from **both** accuracy and diplomacy.
 - :guilabel:`Creative`: approaches questions in a more human way, changes answers every time to
   react to the conversation. This option works best for times when the solutions often vary based
   on the situation.

Tick the :guilabel:`Restrict to Sources` checkbox to limit the agent to **only** respond based on
the provided resources.

Next, select one or more :guilabel:`Topics` for the agent. As explained above, :ref:`Topics
<ai/topics>` include both instructions and tools that guide the agent in helping users complete a
task.

Enter a :guilabel:`System Prompt` with detailed instructions for the agent as to their role and
responsibilities.

.. tip::
   The specificity and length of the :guilabel:`System Prompt` can vary, depending on the use case
   for the agent. Use the preconfigured agents as an example of the possible information.

.. image:: agents/new-agent.png
   :alt: A new agent form with the required information.

If *Sources* are needed for the agent, scroll to the :guilabel:`Sources` tab, then click
:guilabel:`Add a source`.

Select a format:

 - PDFs: Select the appropriate file from the explorer window, and click :guilabel:`Open`
 - Weblinks: paste the URL. Multiple links can be added at once, paste one link per line. Click
   :guilabel:`Save`.
 - Documents (uploaded in the **Documents** application): Tick the checkbox next to one or more
   documents, then click :guilabel:`Select`.
 - **Knowledge** app articles: Tick the checkbox next to one or more articles, then click
   :guilabel:`Select`.

Once a source is added, the :guilabel:`Status` field updates to reflect its current status. The
source is ready when the status changes from *Processing* to *Indexed*. Slide the :guilabel:`Active`
toggle to activate the source.

.. image:: agents/sources.png
   :alt: A list of sources for an agent, each denoted with their format.

.. important::
   If a source fails to upload, it could be the result of a conflict with the selected LLM model.

Click the :guilabel:`Test` button to open a conversation window and test the new agent.

AI fields
=========

.. |AI| replace:: :abbr:`AI (Artificial Intelligence)`

|AI| fields allow users to utilize Odoo's built-in AI capabilities directly in forms and records.
When an |AI| field is configured, the system can generate or suggest values automatically based on
the record's context, existing data, or external information.

This feature is especially useful for creating product descriptions, summarizing notes, or
generating structured content from unstructured data.

.. _ai/add-a-new-field:

Adding a new AI field
=====================

|AI| fields can be added to a record through the Studio app or property field.

.. warning::
   :ref:`Installing Studio <general/install>` may impact the current pricing plan for a database.
   For more information, refer to `Odoo's pricing page <https://www.odoo.com/pricing-plan>`_ or
   contact your account manager.

First, navigate to the page in the database where a new field is needed. Then, click on the
:icon:`oi-studio` :guilabel:`studio` icon to open the app. On the left sidebar, click and drag the
:guilabel:`AI Field` option and place it in the desired location on the record.

.. image:: fields/new-ai-field.png

Next is the :guilabel:`Prompt` field. In Odoo, :ref:`prompts <ai/agents/prompts-in-odoo>` define the
instructions that guide the |AI| when generating or improving the content of the |AI| field. The
prompt tells the system what kind of information to produce, how to format it, and what tone or
style to use.

When creating a prompt, use the `/field` command to reference specific fields in the database. For
example, to reference the :guilabel:`Company` field on a record, enter `/field`, and click the
:guilabel:`Field Selector` option. Type `Company` in the search bar, and select :guilabel:`Company`
from the list.

.. image:: fields/prompt.png

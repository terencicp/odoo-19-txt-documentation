Upgrade scripts
===============

An upgrade script is a Python file containing a function called :meth:`migrate`, which the upgrade
process invokes during the update of a module.

.. method:: migrate(cr, version)

   :param cr: current database cursor
   :type cr: :class:`~odoo.sql_db.Cursor`
   :param str version: installed version of the module

Typically, this function executes one or multiple SQL queries and can also access Odoo's ORM, as
well as the :doc:`./upgrade_utils`.

Writing upgrade scripts
=======================

Upgrade scripts follow a specific tree structure with a naming convention which determines when they
are executed.

The structure of an upgrade script path is :file:`$module/migrations/$version/{pre,post,end}-*.py`,
where `$module` is the module for which the script will run, `$version` is the full version of the
module (including Odoo's major version and the module's minor version) and `{pre|post|end}-*.py` is
the file that needs to be executed. The file's name will determine the :ref:`phase
<upgrade-scripts/phases>` and order in which it is executed for that module and version.

.. note::
   From Odoo 13 the top-level directory for the upgrade scripts can also be named `upgrades`. This
   naming is preferred since it has the correct meaning: *migrate* can be confused with *moving out
   of Odoo*. Thus :file:`$module/upgrades/$version/` is also valid.

.. note::
   Upgrade scripts are only executed when the module is being updated. Therefore, the
   module's minor version set in the `$version` directory needs to be higher than the module's
   installed version and equal or lower to the updated version of the module.

.. example::

   Directory structure of an upgrade script for a custom module named `awesome_partner` upgraded
   to version `2.0` on Odoo 17.

   .. code-block:: text

      awesome_partner/
      |-- migrations/
      |   |-- 17.0.2.0/
      |   |   |-- pre-exclamation.py

   Two upgrade scripts examples with the content of the :file:`pre-exclamation.py`, file adding
   "!" at the end of partners' names:

   .. code-block:: python

      import logging

      _logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


      def migrate(cr, version):
          cr.execute("UPDATE res_partner SET name = name || '!'")
          _logger.info("Updated %s partners", cr.rowcount)

   .. code-block:: python

      import logging
      from odoo.upgrade import util

      _logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


      def migrate(cr, version):
          env = util.env(cr)

          partners = env["res.partner"].search([])
          for partner in partners:
              partner.name += "!"

          _logger.info("Updated %s partners", len(partners))

   Note that in the second example, the script takes advantage of the :doc:`./upgrade_utils` to
   access the ORM. Check the documentation to find out more about this library.

.. _upgrade-scripts/phases:

Phases of upgrade scripts
=========================

The upgrade process consists of three phases for each version of each module:

  #. The pre-phase, before the module is loaded.
  #. The post-phase, after the module and its dependencies are loaded and updated.
  #. The end-phase, after all modules have been loaded and updated for that version.

Upgrade scripts are grouped according to the first part of their filenames into the corresponding
phase. Within each phase, the files are executed according to their lexical order.

.. admonition:: Execution order of example scripts for one module in one version

   #. :file:`pre-10-do_something.py`
   #. :file:`pre-20-something_else.py`
   #. :file:`post-do_something.py`
   #. :file:`post-something.py`
   #. :file:`end-01-migrate.py`
   #. :file:`end-migrate.py`

=============
Upgrade utils
=============

`Upgrade utils <https://github.com/odoo/upgrade-util/>`_ is a library that contains helper functions
to facilitate the writing of upgrade scripts. This library, used by Odoo for the upgrade scripts of
standard modules, provides reliability and helps speed up the upgrade process:

- The helper functions help make sure the data is consistent in the database.
- It takes care of indirect references of the updated records.
- Allows calling functions and avoid writing code, saving time and reducing development risks.
- Helpers allow to focus on what is important for the upgrade and not think of details.

Installation
============

Clone the `Upgrade utils repository <https://github.com/odoo/upgrade-util/>`_ locally and start
``odoo`` with the ``src`` directory prepended to the ``--upgrade-path`` option.

.. code-block:: console

   $ ./odoo-bin --upgrade-path=/path/to/upgrade-util/src,/path/to/other/upgrade/script/directory [...]

On platforms where you do not manage Odoo yourself, you can install this library via `pip`:

.. code-block:: console

   $ python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/odoo/upgrade-util@master

On `Odoo.sh <https://www.odoo.sh/>`_ it is recommended to add it to the :file:`requirements.txt` of
the custom repository. For this, add the following line inside the file::

   odoo_upgrade @ git+https://github.com/odoo/upgrade-util@master

Using upgrade utils
===================

Once installed, the following packages are available for the upgrade scripts:

- :mod:`odoo.upgrade.util`: the helper itself.
- :mod:`odoo.upgrade.testing`: base TestCase classes.

To use it in upgrade scripts, simply import it:

.. code-block:: python

   from odoo.upgrade import util


   def migrate(cr, version):
      # Rest of the script

Now, the helper functions are available to be called through ``util``.

Util functions
==============

Upgrade utils provides many useful functions to ease the upgrade process. Here, we describe some
of the most useful ones. Refer to the `util folder
<https://github.com/odoo/upgrade-util/tree/master/src/util>`_ for the comprehensive declaration of
helper functions.

.. note::

   The :attr:`cr` parameter in util functions always refers to the database cursor. Pass the one
   received as a parameter in :meth:`migrate`. Not all functions need this parameter.

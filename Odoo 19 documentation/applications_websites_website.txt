==================================================

====================
Address autocomplete
====================

You can use the Google Places API on your website to ensure that your users' delivery addresses
exist and are understood by the carrier. The Google Places API allows developers to access detailed
information about places using HTTP requests. The autocompletion predicts a list of places when the
user starts typing the address.

   - `Google Developers Documentation: Google Places API
     <https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/autocomplete>`_

To do so, go to :menuselection:`Website --> Configuration --> Settings` and enable
:guilabel:`Address Autocomplete` in the :guilabel:`SEO` section.

.. image:: address_autocomplete/enable-address-autocomplete.png
   :alt: Enable address autocomplete

Insert your :guilabel:`Google Places API key` in the :guilabel:`API Key` field. If you don't have
one, create yours on the `Google Cloud Console <https://console.cloud.google.com/getting-started>`_
and follow these steps.

.. _address_autocomplete/generate_api_key:

Step 1: Enable the Google Places API
====================================

**Create a New Project:**
To enable the **Google Places API**, you first need to create a project. To do so, click
:guilabel:`Select a project` in the top left corner, :guilabel:`New Project`, and follow the prompts
to set up your project.

**Enable the Google Places API:**
Go to the :guilabel:`Enabled APIs & Services` and click :guilabel:`+ ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES.`
Search for :guilabel:`"Places API"` and select it. Click on the :guilabel:`"Enable"` button.

.. note::
   Google's pricing depends on the number of requests and their complexity.

Step 2: Create API Credentials
==============================

Go to `APIs & Services --> Credentials <https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials>`_.

**Create credentials:**
To create your credentials, go to :guilabel:`Credentials`, click :guilabel:`Create Credentials`, and
select :guilabel:`API key`.

.. admonition:: Restrict the API Key (Optional)

   For security purposes, you can restrict the usage of your API key. You can go to the
   :guilabel:`API restrictions` section to specify which APIs your key can access. For the Google
   Places API, you can restrict it to only allow requests from specific websites or apps.

.. important::
   - Save Your API Key: copy your API key and securely store it.
   - Do not share it publicly or expose it in client-side code.

==================================================

=================
Website analytics
=================

Website analytics helps website owners monitor how people use their site. It provides data on
visitor demographics, behavior, and interactions, helping improve websites and marketing strategies.

You can track your Odoo website's traffic using :ref:`analytics/plausible` or
:ref:`analytics/google-analytics`. We recommend using Plausible.io as it is privacy-friendly,
lightweight, and easy to use.

The Plausible Analytics dashboard is also integrated into Odoo and can be accessed
via :menuselection:`Website --> Reporting --> Analytics`.

.. _analytics/plausible:

Plausible.io
============

Odoo hosts its own Plausible.io server and provides a free and ready-to-use Plausible.io
solution for **Odoo Online** databases that use the odoo.com domain. Odoo automatically creates and
sets up your account. Start using it by going to :menuselection:`Website --> Reporting -->
Analytics`.

.. note::
   - If you use a custom :doc:`domain name <../configuration/domain_names>` (e.g., `example.com`),
     you need to create your own Plausible.io account and subscription.
   - **If you already have a Plausible.io account** and you want to connect it to your Odoo Online
     database, you must create two `ir.config.parameters` to use Plausible.io's servers. To do so,
     enable the :ref:`developer mode <developer-mode>` and go to :menuselection:`General Settings -->
     Technical --> System Parameters`. Click :guilabel:`New` and fill in the following
     :guilabel:`Key` and :guilabel:`Value` fields:

     .. list-table::
        :header-rows: 1

        * - Key
          - Value
        * - `website.plausible_script`
          - `https://plausible.io/js/plausible.js`
        * - `website.plausible_server`
          - `https://plausible.io`

   Then, follow the steps below to connect your existing account with Plausible.io servers.

   .. warning::
      Deactivating the free Plausible.io account linked to your **Odoo Online** database
      will also remove the existing keys. As a result, new keys will be generated, while all
      historical data will remain associated with the old keys. If you plan to deactivate the
      account, it is recommended to save the existing keys to preserve access to that data.

If your database is hosted on **Odoo.sh** or **On-premise**, or if you wish to use your own
Plausible.io account, proceed as follows:

#. Create or sign in to a Plausible.io account using the following link: `<https://plausible.io/register>`_.
#. If you are creating a new account, go through the registration and activation steps.
   On the :guilabel:`Add website info` page, add the :guilabel:`Domain` of your website without
   including `www` (e.g., `example.odoo.com`) and change the :guilabel:`Reporting Timezone`,
   if necessary. Click :guilabel:`Install Plausible` to proceed to the next step. Ignore the
   :guilabel:`Manual installation` instructions and click :guilabel:`Start collecting data`.
#. Once done, click the Plausible.io logo in the upper-left part of the page to access your `list of
   websites <https://plausible.io/sites>`_, then click the :icon:`fa-ellipsis-v`
   (:guilabel:`ellipsis`) icon next to the website and select :icon:`fa-cog` :guilabel:`Settings`
   from the drop-down menu.

   .. image:: analytics/plausible-gear-icon-settings.png
      :alt: Click the gear icon in the list of websites.

#. In the sidebar, select :guilabel:`Visibility`, then click :guilabel:`Add Shared link`.
#. Enter a :guilabel:`Name`, leave the :guilabel:`Password (optional)` field empty, as the Plausible
   analytics dashboard integration in Odoo does not support it, then click :guilabel:`Create
   shared link`.

#. Copy the shared link.

   .. image:: analytics/plausible-copy-shared-link.png
      :alt: Copy the shared link URL from Plausible.io

#. In Odoo, go to :menuselection:`Website --> Configuration --> Settings`.
#. In the :guilabel:`SEO` section, enable :guilabel:`Plausible Analytics`, then paste the
   :guilabel:`Shared Link Auth` and click :guilabel:`Save`.

.. tip::
   If you have :doc:`multiple websites <../configuration/multi_website>`, add your websites to your
   Plausible.io account by going to `<https://plausible.io/sites>`_ and clicking :guilabel:`+ Add
   Website`. In Odoo, in the **Website settings**, make sure to select the website in the
   :guilabel:`Settings of Website` field at the top of the page before pasting the
   :guilabel:`Shared link`.

.. note::
   Odoo automatically pushes two custom goals: `Lead Generation` and `Shop`.

.. _analytics/google-analytics:

Google Analytics
================

To follow your Odoo website's traffic with Google Analytics:

#. Create or sign in to a Google account using the following link: `<https://analytics.google.com>`_.
#. - If you are setting up Google Analytics for the first time, click :guilabel:`Start measuring`
     and go through the account creation step.
   - If you already have a Google Analytics account, sign in and click the :icon:`fa-cog` icon
     in the bottom-left corner of the page to access the **Admin** page. Then, click
     :guilabel:`+ Create` and select :guilabel:`Property` from the drop-down menu.

#. Complete the next steps: `property creation <https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9304153?hl=en/&visit_id=638278591144564289-3612494643&rd=2#property>`_,
   business details and business objectives.
#. When you reach the **Data collection** step, choose the :guilabel:`Web` platform.

   .. image:: analytics/GA-platform.png
      :alt: Choose a platform for your Google Analytics property.

#. Set up your data stream: Specify your :guilabel:`Website URL` and a :guilabel:`Stream name`, then
   click :guilabel:`Create & continue`.
#. Copy the :guilabel:`Measurement ID`.

   .. image:: analytics/GA-measurement-id.png
      :alt: Measurement ID in Google Analytics.

#. In Odoo, go to :menuselection:`Website --> Configuration --> Settings`.
#. In the :guilabel:`SEO` section, enable :guilabel:`Google Analytics`, then paste the
   :guilabel:`Measurement ID` and click :guilabel:`Save`.

.. tip::
   If you have :doc:`multiple websites <../configuration/multi_website>` with separate domains, it
   is recommended to create `one property <https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9304153?hl=en/&visit_id=638278591144564289-3612494643&rd=2#property>`_
   per domain. In Odoo, in the **Website settings**, make sure to select the website in the
   :guilabel:`Settings of Website` field at the top of the page before pasting the
   :guilabel:`Measurement ID`.

   <https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008015?hl=en/>`_

.. _analytics/google-tag-manager:

Google Tag Manager
==================

Google Tag Manager is a tag management system that allows you to easily update
measurement codes and related code fragments, collectively known as tags on your website or mobile
app, directly through the code injector.

.. note::
   :abbr:`GTM (Google Tag Manager)` is not an analytics tool and does not offer reporting features;
   it is used to collect data and works alongside Google Analytics to provide more detailed
   insights. In order to use GTM properly, it is recommended to configure Google Analytics as well.

   For more information refer to the `documentation on linking Google Analytics and
   Google Tag Manager <https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/9442095?hl=en>`_.

.. warning::
   - Some GTM tags use data layers (e.g., advanced eCommerce tracking data layers) to retrieve
     variables and send them to Google Analytics. Data layers are currently not managed in Odoo.
   - Google Tag Manager may not be compliant with local data protection regulations.

To configure GTM, proceed as follows:

#. Create or sign in to a Google account by going to https://tagmanager.google.com/.

#. In the :guilabel:`Accounts` tab, click :guilabel:`Create Account`.

#. Enter an :guilabel:`Account Name` and select the account's :guilabel:`Country`.

#. Enter your website's URL in the :guilabel:`Container name` field and select the :guilabel:`Target
   platform`.

#. Click :guilabel:`Create` and agree to the Terms of Service.

#. Copy the `<head>` and `<body>` codes from the popup window. Then, go to your website, click
   :guilabel:`Edit`, go to the :guilabel:`Theme` tab, scroll down to the
   :guilabel:`Advanced` section, then click :guilabel:`<head>` and :guilabel:`</body>` next to
   :guilabel:`Code Injection` to paste the codes.

   .. image:: analytics/gtm-codes.png
      :alt: Install Google Tag Manager

.. note::
   The data is collected in the marketing tools used to monitor the website (e.g., Google Analytics,
   Plausible, Facebook Pixel), not in Odoo.

Building blocks
===============

You can design your website by :ref:`dragging and dropping building blocks
<website/building_blocks/add>`, then :ref:`editing them <website/building_blocks/edit>` to fit your
content and layout needs.

.. seealso::
   `Odoo Tutorial: Design your website: text and colors <https://www.odoo.com/slides/slide/design-your-website-text-and-colors-6930?fullscreen=1>`_

.. _website/building_blocks/add:

Add a building block
====================

To add a block to a :doc:`website page <../structure/pages>`, access the page, click :guilabel:`Edit`, then
drag and drop the desired building block into the appropriate location. Two types of building blocks
are available: :guilabel:`Categories` and :guilabel:`Inner Content`. :guilabel:`Inner Content`
building blocks can only be added into :guilabel:`Categories` building blocks.

When clicking on a category block, a popup appears, allowing you to select between multiple
templates for each category.

.. tip::
   You can also search for a specific block in the :guilabel:`Insert a block` popup using the
   search bar.

  .. image:: building_blocks/insert-a-block.png
      :alt: Pop-up block selection

Once the category block is placed, you can drag and drop :guilabel:`Inner content` blocks
within it. The :guilabel:`Inner content` blocks allow you to add elements, such as videos, images,
social media buttons, etc., into pre-existing category blocks.

.. note::
   Access to certain blocks requires the installation of their respective application or module
   (e.g., eCommerce for the :guilabel:`Products` block).

.. example::
   Add all your social media accounts in one place with the inner content :guilabel:`Social Media`
   block. Toggle the switch on or off next to the desired platform and copy/paste your account URL.

   .. image:: building_blocks/social-media-inner-content.png
      :alt: Social Media inner content block

.. _website/building_blocks/form:

Form
----

The :guilabel:`Form` block is used to collect information from website visitors and create records
in your database, if applicable. To add a form to a website page, drag and drop the
:guilabel:`Contact & Forms` category, then select the :guilabel:`Form block`.

.. image:: building_blocks/form-block.png
   :alt: Example of a form block

.. _website/building_blocks/action:

Action
~~~~~~

By default, when the form is submitted, an email containing the information entered by the visitor
is automatically sent. Depending on the apps installed on your database, additional actions that can
automatically create records may become available. To choose a different action, click
:guilabel:`Edit`, click the form, navigate to the :guilabel:`Customize` tab, and select the desired
:guilabel:`Action`:

- :guilabel:`Apply for a Job` (:doc:`Recruitment </applications/hr/recruitment>`)
- :guilabel:`Create a Customer` (:doc:`eCommerce <../../ecommerce>`)
- :guilabel:`Create a Ticket` (:doc:`Helpdesk </applications/services/helpdesk>`)
- :guilabel:`Create an Opportunity` (:doc:`CRM </applications/sales/crm>`)
- :guilabel:`Subscribe to Newsletter` (:doc:`Email Marketing </applications/marketing/email_marketing>`)
- :guilabel:`Create a Task` (:doc:`Project </applications/services/project>`)

.. image:: building_blocks/inner-content-edit-form.png
   :alt: Editing a form to change its action

By default, submitting the form redirects visitors to a *Thank you* page. Use the :guilabel:`URL`
field to send them to a different page. Alternatively, you can choose not to redirect and keep
them on the form's page by selecting :guilabel:`Nothing` or :guilabel:`Show Message` in the
:guilabel:`On Success` field.

Fields
~~~~~~

To add a new field to the form, navigate to the :guilabel:`Customize tab` and click the
:guilabel:`+ Field` button next to the :guilabel:`Form` or :guilabel:`Field` section. To modify the
new (or any other) field on the form, select the field, then use the options available in the
:guilabel:`Field` section of the :guilabel:`Customize` tab. For example, you can:

- Change the field :guilabel:`Type`.

  .. tip::
     It is also possible to select an :guilabel:`Existing Field` from the database and use the data
     it contains. The fields available depend on the selected action. Property fields added to the
     database can also be used.

  .. spoiler:: Click here to preview all field types.

     .. image:: building_blocks/all-types-of-field.png
        :alt: All types of form fields

     Some fields are visually similar, but the data entered must follow a specific format.

- Edit the field's :guilabel:`Label` and adapt its :guilabel:`Position`.
- Enable a field :guilabel:`Description`. Click the default description on the form to modify it.
- Add a :guilabel:`Placeholder` or :guilabel:`Default value`.
- Specify if the field is :guilabel:`Required`.
- Edit the field's :doc:`visibility <visibility>` settings.
- Add an :ref:`animation <website/elements/animations>`.

Once you have made the desired changes, click :guilabel:`Save`.

Add an Odoo contact form on a non-Odoo website
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can display an Odoo contact form on another website using an iframe. To do so, follow these
steps:

#. **Prepare the Odoo form:** Create a contact form on a page in Odoo Website and remove the
   :ref:`header design <website/header_footer/header-design>` and the :ref:`footer design
   <website/header_footer/footer-design>`. Make sure only the contact form remains on the page.
#. **Generate an embeddable code:** Copy the URL of the Odoo form page and paste it into an iframe
   generator, such as `La Digitale.dev <https://ladigitale.dev/digitools/generateur-iframe>`_ or
   `iFrame Generator <https://www.iframe-generator.com/>`_ . Adjust the width and height for proper
   display.
#. **Add the embedded code to the non-Odoo website:** Open the relevant page’s HTML (in the code
   editor or CMS) and insert the embedded code where the form should be displayed.

Deploying with KeyCDN
=====================

A :abbr:`CDN (Content Delivery Network)` or *content distribution network*, is a geographically
distributed network of servers that provides high speed internet content. The :abbr:`CDN (Content
Delivery Network)` provides quick, high-quality content delivery for content-heavy websites.

This document will guide you through the setup of a KeyCDN_ account with an Odoo powered website.

------------------------------------------

On the KeyCDN dashboard, start by navigating to the :menuselection:`Zones` menu item on the left. On
the form, give a value to the :guilabel:`Zone Name`, which will appear as part of the :abbr:`CDN
(Content Delivery Network)`'s :abbr:`URL (Uniform Resource Locator)`. Then, set the :guilabel:`Zone
Status` to :guilabel:`active` to engage the zone. For the :guilabel:`Zone Type` set the value to
:guilabel:`Pull`, and then, finally, under the :guilabel:`Pull Settings`, enter the
:guilabel:`Origin URL`— this address should be the full Odoo database :abbr:`URL (Uniform Resource
Locator)`.

.. example::
   Use ``https://yourdatabase.odoo.com`` and replace the *yourdatabase* subdomain prefix with the
   actual name of the database. A custom :abbr:`URL (Uniform Resource Locator)` can be used, as
   well, in place of the Odoo subdomain that was provided to the database.

.. image:: cdn/keycdn-zone.png
   :align: center
   :alt: KeyCDN's Zone configuration page.

Under the :guilabel:`General Settings` heading below the zone form, click the :guilabel:`Show all
settings` button to expand the zone options. This should be the last option on the page. After
expanding the :guilabel:`General Settings` ensure that the :guilabel:`CORS` option is
:guilabel:`enabled`.

Next, scroll to the bottom of the zone configuration page and :guilabel:`Save` the changes. KeyCDN
will indicate that the new zone will be deployed. This can take about 10 minutes.

.. image:: cdn/zone-url.png
   :align: center
   :alt: KeyCDN deploying the new Zone.

.. note::
   A new :guilabel:`Zone URL` has been generated for your Zone, in this example it is
   ``pulltest-xxxxx.kxcdn.com``. This value will differ for each database.

Copy this :guilabel:`Zone URL` to a text editor for later, as it will be used in the next steps.

Configure the Odoo instance with the new zone
---------------------------------------------

In the Odoo :guilabel:`Website` app, go to the :menuselection:`Settings` and then activate the
:guilabel:`Content Delivery Network (CDN)` setting and copy/paste the :guilabel:`Zone URL` value
from the earlier step into the :guilabel:`CDN Base URL` field. This field is only visible and
configurable when the :ref:`developer mode <developer-mode>` is activated.

.. note::
   Ensure that there are two *forward slashes* (`//`) before the :guilabel:`CDN Base URL` and one
   forward slash (`/`) after the :guilabel:`CDN Base URL`.

:guilabel:`Save` the settings when complete.

.. image:: cdn/cdn-base-url.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Activate the CDN setting in Odoo.

Now the website is using the CDN for the resources matching the :guilabel:`CDN filters` regular
expressions.

In the HTML of the Odoo website, the :abbr:`CDN (content delivery network)` integration is evidenced
as working properly by checking the :abbr:`URL (Uniform Resource Locators)` of images. The *CDN Base
URL* value can be seen by using your web browser's :guilabel:`Inspect` feature on the Odoo website.
Look for it's record by searching within the :guilabel:`Network` tab inside of devtools.

.. image:: cdn/test-pull.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The CDN Base URL can be seen using the inspect function on the Odoo website.

Prevent security issues by activating cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

A security restriction in some browsers (such as Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome) prevents a
remotely linked CSS file to fetch relative resources on this same external server.

If the :abbr:`CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)` option isn't enabled in the :guilabel:`CDN
Zone`, the more obvious resulting problem on a standard Odoo website will be the lack of *Font
Awesome* icons because the font file declared in the *Font Awesome* CSS won't be loaded from the
remote server.

When these cross-origin resource issues occur, a security error message similar to the output
below will appear in the web browser's developer console:

``Font from origin 'http://pulltest-xxxxx.kxcdn.com' has been blocked from loading /shop:1 by
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the
requested resource. Origin 'http://yourdatabase.odoo.com' is therefore not allowed access.``

.. image:: cdn/odoo-security-message.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Error message populated in the browser console.

Enabling the :abbr:`CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)` option in the :abbr:`CDN (Content Delivery
Network)` settings fixes this issue.

Cookies bar
===========

**Cookies** are small text files sent to your device when you visit a website. They are processed
and stored by your browser and record visitor information like login details, preferences, and
browsing history. **Essential cookies** are necessary for the website to function, while
**optional cookies** are used to analyze behavior or display ads.

Data protection laws require notifying visitors about data collection methods and purposes.
**Cookies bar** fulfill this obligation by informing visitors on their first visit and allowing them
to decide whether to store all or only essential cookies on their device.

.. note::
   - Cookies bars are required to obtain visitors' consent for optional cookies only. Consent is not
     required for essential cookies.

   - Odoo is compliant with `Google consent mode v2 <https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/13695607>`_.

Configuration
=============

To add a cookies bar on your website, go to :menuselection:`Website --> Configuration -->
Settings` and enable :guilabel:`Cookies Bar` in the :guilabel:`Tracking & SEO` section. This
activates :guilabel:`Block tracking 3rd-party services` by default, including social media, video
hosting platforms, and Google services. Click :guilabel:`Add domains to the block list` to include
other external websites. These services remain blocked on your website until visitors accept
optional cookies.

.. note::
   Using third-party cookies without a cookies bar does not prevent them from being triggered. Only
   the presence of a cookie bar **and** the visitor’s refusal ensure that these cookies are blocked.

.. _cookies-bar/policy:

Cookies policy
==============

When you enable the cookies bar for your website, Odoo creates the **Cookie Policy** page
(`/cookie-policy`) containing a list of cookies set by default, with their purpose and examples.

SECTION: domain_names.rst
PATH: applications/websites/website/configuration/domain_names.rst
==================================================

============
Domain names
============

Domain names are text-based addresses identifying online locations, such as websites. They provide a
more memorable and recognizable way for people to navigate the internet than numerical IP addresses.

**Odoo Online** and **Odoo.sh** databases use a **subdomain** of the `odoo.com` **domain** by
default (e.g., `mycompany.odoo.com`).

However, you can use a custom domain name instead by :ref:`registering a free domain name
<domain-name/register>` (only available for Odoo Online databases) or by :ref:`configuring a
domain name you already own <domain-name/existing>`.

.. seealso::
   - `Odoo Tutorials: Register a free domain name [video]

     <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sXbp7sC6TKG2v-8hcRAMhA6ftKmRxba_>`_

.. _domain-name/register:

Register a free domain name with Odoo
=====================================

To register a one-year free domain name for your Odoo Online database, sign in to your account and
go to the `database manager <https://www.odoo.com/my/databases>`_. Click the :icon:`fa-gear`
(:guilabel:`gear`) button next to the database name and select :icon:`fa-globe` :guilabel:`Domain
Names`.

.. image:: domain_names/domain-names.png
   :alt: Accessing a database's domain names configuration

Search for the desired domain name and check its availability.

.. image:: domain_names/domain-search.png
   :alt: Searching for an available domain name

.. tip::
   Ensure the Website app is installed if the domain name registration option does not appear.

Select the desired domain name, fill in the :guilabel:`Domain Owner` form, and click
:guilabel:`Register`. The chosen domain name is directly linked to the database.

.. image:: domain_names/domain-owner.png
   :alt: Filling in the domain owner information

Next, you should :ref:`map your domain name to your Odoo website <domain-name/website-map>`.

.. important::
   A verification email from `noreply@domainnameverification.net` will be sent to the email address
   provided in the :guilabel:`Domain Owner` form. It is essential to verify your email address to
   keep the domain active and receive the renewal quote before expiration.

The domain name registration is free for the first year. After this period, Odoo will continue to
manage the domain in partnership with **Gandi.net**, the domain name registrar, and you will be
charged `Gandi.net's renewal rate <https://www.gandi.net/en/domain>`_. Odoo sends a renewal
quotation every year to the email address mentioned in the :guilabel:`Domain Owner` form several
weeks before the expiration date of the domain. The domain is renewed automatically when the
quotation is confirmed.

.. note::
   - The offer is only available for **Odoo Online** databases.
   - The offer is limited to **one** domain name per client.
   - The offer is limited to the registration of a **new** domain name.
   - The offer is available to *One App Free* plans. Ensure that your website contains enough
     original content for Odoo to verify that your request is legitimate and respects `Odoo's
     Acceptable Use Policy <https://www.odoo.com/acceptable-use>`_. Given the high number of
     requests, it can take Odoo several days to review them.

.. _domain-name/register-dns:

DNS records
-----------

To manage your free domain name :abbr:`DNS (domain name system)` records, open the `database manager
<https://www.odoo.com/my/databases>`_, click the :icon:`fa-gear` (:guilabel:`gear`) button next to
the database name, select :icon:`fa-globe` :guilabel:`Domain Names`, and click :guilabel:`DNS`.

- :guilabel:`A`: the A record holds the IP address of the domain. It is automatically created and
  **cannot** be edited or deleted.
- :guilabel:`CNAME`: CNAME records forward one domain or subdomain to another domain. One is
  automatically created to map the `www.` subdomain to the database. If the database is renamed, the
  CNAME record **must** also be renamed.
- :guilabel:`MX`: MX records instruct servers on where to deliver emails.
- :guilabel:`TXT`: TXT records can be used for different purposes (e.g., to verify domain name
  ownership).

Any modification to the DNS records can take up to **72 hours** to propagate worldwide on all
servers.

.. note::
   `Contact Odoo support <https://www.odoo.com/help>`_ if you need assistance to manage your domain
   name.

Mailbox
-------

The one-year free domain name offer does **not** include a mailbox. There are two options to link
your domain name with a mailbox.

Use a subdomain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can create a subdomain (e.g., `subdomain.yourdomain.com`) to use as an alias domain for the
database. It allows users to create records in the database from emails received on their
`email@subdomain.yourdomain.com` alias.

To do so, open the `database manager <https://www.odoo.com/my/databases>`_, click the
:icon:`fa-gear` (:guilabel:`gear`) button next to the database name and select :icon:`fa-globe`
:guilabel:`Domain Names`. Click :guilabel:`DNS`, then :guilabel:`Add DNS record` and select
:guilabel:`CNAME`. Next, enter the desired subdomain in the :guilabel:`Name` field (e.g.,
`subdomain`), the original database domain with a period at the end (e.g., `mycompany.odoo.com.`) in
the :guilabel:`Content` field, and click :guilabel:`Add record`.

Then, add the alias domain as your *own domain* by clicking :guilabel:`Use my own domain`, entering
the alias domain (e.g., `subdomain.yourdomain.com`), clicking :guilabel:`Verify`, and then
:guilabel:`I confirm, it's done`.

Finally, go to your database and open the :guilabel:`Settings`. Under the :guilabel:`Alias Domain`
field, enter the alias domain (e.g., `subdomain.yourdomain.com`), click :guilabel:`Create`, and then
:guilabel:`Save`.

Use an external email provider
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use an external email provider, you should configure an MX record. To do so, open the `database
manager <https://www.odoo.com/my/databases>`_, click the :icon:`fa-gear` (:guilabel:`gear`) button
next to the database name and select :icon:`fa-globe` :guilabel:`Domain Names`. Click
:guilabel:`DNS`, then :guilabel:`Add DNS record` and select :guilabel:`MX`. The values you should
enter for the :guilabel:`Name`, :guilabel:`Content`, and :guilabel:`Priority` fields depend on the
external email provider.

Google Workspace
****************

To use your free domain name on Gmail, register to `Google Workspace
<https://workspace.google.com>`_.

During the registration process, select :guilabel:`Set up using your existing domain` when asked to
:guilabel:`Choose a way to set up your account`, and enter your domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`) when
asked :guilabel:`What's your business's domain name?`.

.. _domain-name/existing:

Configure an existing domain name
=================================

If you already have a domain name, you can use it for your Odoo website.

.. warning::
   It is strongly recommended to follow **in order** these three steps to avoid any :ref:`SSL
   certificate validation <domain-name/ssl>` issues:

   #. :ref:`Add a CNAME record <domain-name/cname>`
   #. :ref:`Redirect your naked domain name <domain-name/naked>` (optional, but recommended)
   #. :ref:`Map your domain name to your Odoo database <domain-name/db-map>`
   #. :ref:`Map your domain name to your Odoo website <domain-name/website-map>`

.. _domain-name/cname:

Add a CNAME record
------------------

Adding a CNAME record to forward your domain name to the address of your Odoo database is required.

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Odoo Online

      The CNAME record's target address should be your database's address as defined at its creation
      (e.g., `mycompany.odoo.com`).

   .. group-tab:: Odoo.sh

      The CNAME record's target address should be the project's main address, which can be found on
      Odoo.sh by going to :menuselection:`Settings --> Project Name`, or a specific branch
      (production, staging or development) by going to :menuselection:`Branches --> select the
      branch --> Settings --> Custom domains`, and clicking :guilabel:`How to set up my domain?`. A
      message indicates which address your CNAME record should target.

The specific instructions depend on your DNS hosting service.

.. seealso::

     <https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/>`_

.. _domain-name/naked:

Redirect a naked domain
-----------------------

.. note::
   Although optional, completing this step is advised.

To let visitors use your naked domain name :dfn:`(a domain name without any subdomains or prefixes)`
(`yourdomain.com`), creating a 301 redirect :dfn:`(a permanent redirect from one URL to another)`
to `www.yourdomain.com` is required:

- from `http://yourdomain.com` to `https://www.yourdomain.com`, and
- from `https://yourdomain.com` to `https://www.yourdomain.com`.

The specific instructions depend on your DNS hosting service. However, not all of them offer to
redirect a naked domain with a secure HTTPS connection. If you encounter any issue, we recommend
:ref:`using Cloudflare <domain-name/naked/cloudflare>`.

.. _domain-name/naked/cloudflare:

Using Cloudflare to secure and redirect a naked domain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. `Sign up and log in to Cloudflare <https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up>`_.
#. Enter your domain name on `Cloudflare's dashboard <https://dash.cloudflare.com/login>`_ and
   select :guilabel:`Quick scan for DNS records`.
#. Choose a plan (the free plan is sufficient).
#. Follow Cloudflare's instructions and recommendations to complete the activation.
#. Add a CNAME record to redirect your naked domain (`yourdomain.com`) to the `www` subdomain
   (e.g., `www.yourdomain.com`) by clicking :guilabel:`DNS` in the navigation menu, then clicking
   the :guilabel:`Add record` button, and using the following configuration:

   - :guilabel:`Type`: CNAME
   - :guilabel:`Name`: `@` (or `yourdomain.com`)
   - :guilabel:`Target`: e.g., `www.yourdomain.com`
   - :guilabel:`Proxy status`: Proxied

   .. image:: domain_names/cloudflare-cname-www.png
      :alt: Adding a CNAME DNS record to Cloudflare to redirect a naked domain to a www subdomain

#. Add another second CNAME record to redirect the `www` subdomain (e.g., `www.yourdomain.com`) to
   your database address (e.g., `mycompany.odoo.com`) using the following configuration:

   - :guilabel:`Type`: CNAME
   - :guilabel:`Name`: e.g., `www.yourdomain.com`
   - :guilabel:`Target`: e.g., `mycompany.odoo.com`
   - :guilabel:`Proxy status`: DNS only

   .. image:: domain_names/cloudflare-cname-db.png
      :alt: Adding a CNAME DNS record to Cloudflare to redirect a www subdomain to an Odoo database

#. Define a redirect rule to permanently redirect (301) your naked domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`)
   to both `http://` and `https://` by going to :menuselection:`Rules --> Create rule --> Products`,
   and clicking :guilabel:`Create a Rule` under :guilabel:`Redirect Rules`:

   - Enter any :guilabel:`Rule name`.
   - Under the :guilabel:`If incoming requests match...` section, select :guilabel:`Custom filter
     expression` and use the following configuration:

     - :guilabel:`Field`: Hostname
     - :guilabel:`Operator`: equals
     - :guilabel:`Value`: e.g., `yourdomain.com`

   - Under the :guilabel:`Then...` section, use the following configuration:

     - :guilabel:`Type`: Dynamic
     - :guilabel:`Expression`: e.g., `concat("https://www.yourdomain.com", http.request.uri.path)`
     - :guilabel:`Status code`: 301
     - :guilabel:`Preserve query string`: enabled

   .. image:: domain_names/cloudflare-redirect-rule.png

.. _domain-name/db-map:

Map a domain name to an Odoo database
-------------------------------------

.. warning::
   Ensure you have :ref:`added a CNAME record <domain-name/cname>` to your domain name's DNS
   **before** mapping your domain name to your Odoo database.

   Failing to do so may prevent the validation of the :ref:`SSL certificate <domain-name/ssl>` and
   could result in a *certificate name mismatch* error. Web browsers often display this as a
   warning, such as *"Your connection is not private"*.

   If you encounter this error after mapping the domain name to your database, wait up to five
   days, as the validation may still happen. If not, you can `submit a support ticket
   <https://www.odoo.com/help-form>`_, including screenshots of your CNAME records.

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Odoo Online

      Open the `database manager <https://www.odoo.com/my/databases>`_, click the :icon:`fa-gear`
      (:guilabel:`gear`) button next to the database name, select :icon:`fa-globe` :guilabel:`Domain
      Names`, and click :guilabel:`Use my own domain`. Then, enter the domain name (e.g.,

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**SSL encryption** allows visitors to navigate a website through a secure connection, which appears
as the *https://* protocol at the beginning of a web address rather than the non-secure *http://*
protocol.

Odoo generates a separate SSL certificate for each domain :ref:`mapped to a database
<domain-name/db-map>` using `Let's Encrypt's certificate authority and ACME protocol
<https://letsencrypt.org/how-it-works/>`_.

.. note::
   - Certificate generation may take up to 24 hours.
   - Several attempts to validate your certificate are made for five days after you map your domain
     name to your database.
   - If you use another service, you can keep using it or change to Odoo's.

.. important::
   No SSL certificate is generated for naked domains :dfn:`(domain names without any subdomains
   or prefixes)`.

.. _domain-name/web-base-url:

Web base URL of a database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::
   If the Website app is installed on your database, skip this section and continue from the
   :ref:`Map a domain name to a website <domain-name/website-map>` section.

The *web base URL* or root URL of a database affects your main website address and all the
links sent to your customers (e.g., quotations, portal links, etc.).

To make your custom domain name the *web base URL* of your database, access your database using your
custom domain name and log in as an administrator :dfn:`(a user part of the Settings access right
group under Administration)`.

.. important::
   If you access your database with the original Odoo address (e.g., `mycompany.odoo.com`), the *web
   base URL* of your database will be updated accordingly. To prevent the automatic update of the
   *web base URL* when an administrator logs in to the database, activate the :ref:`developer mode
   <developer-mode>`, go to :menuselection:`Settings --> Technical --> System Parameters --> New`,
   and enter `web.base.url.freeze` as the :guilabel:`Key` and `True` as the :guilabel:`Value`.

.. note::
   You can also set the web base URL manually. To do so, activate the :ref:`developer mode
   <developer-mode>`, go to :menuselection:`Settings --> Technical --> System Parameters`, and
   search for the `web.base.url` key (create it if necessary) and enter the full address of your
   website as the value (e.g., `https://www.yourdomain.com`). The URL must include the protocol
   `https://` (or `http://`) and *not* end with a slash (`/`).

.. _domain-name/website-map:

Map a domain name to an Odoo website
------------------------------------

Mapping your domain name to your website is different than mapping it to your database:

- It defines your domain name as the main one for your website, helping search engines to index your
  website correctly.
- It defines your domain name as the base URL for your database, including portal links sent by
  email to your customers.
- If you have multiple websites, it maps your domain name to the appropriate website.

Go to :menuselection:`Website --> Configuration --> Settings`. If you have multiple websites, select
the one you want to configure. In the :guilabel:`Domain` field, enter the address of your website
(e.g., `https://www.yourdomain.com`) and :guilabel:`Save`.

.. warning::
   Mapping your domain name to your Odoo website prevents Google Search from indexing your original
   database address (e.g., `mycompany.odoo.com`).

   If both addresses are already indexed, it may take some time before the indexation of the second
   address is removed from Google Search. You can use the `Google Search Console
   <https://search.google.com/search-console/welcome>`_ to fix the issue.

.. note::
   If you have multiple websites and companies on your database, make sure to select the right
   :guilabel:`Company` under :menuselection:`Website --> Configuration --> Settings`. Doing so
   indicates Odoo which URL to use as the :ref:`base URL <domain-name/web-base-url>` according to
   the company in use.

.. tip::
   When migrating from an existing website, make sure to set up the necessary :ref:`redirects <website/pages/url-redirection>`
   before adding your domain name. For example, if a previous URL like `/path/about/something`
   existed, redirect it to the new corresponding page on your Odoo website, such as `/something`.

SECTION: google_search_console.rst
PATH: applications/websites/website/configuration/google_search_console.rst
==================================================

=====================
Google Search Console
=====================

Google Search Console is a free web service provided by Google that allows website owners to
monitor, maintain, and troubleshoot their site's presence in Google Search results. It offers
valuable insights into how Google views and interacts with your site, helping you optimize its
performance.

To enable Google Search Console for your website, go to `Google Search Console
<https://search.google.com/search-console/welcome>`_. Then, select the property type
:ref:`GSC-Domain` or :ref:`GSC-URL prefix`.

.. image:: google_search_console/add-domain-or-url-prefix.png
   :alt: Google Search Console domain or URL prefix

.. _GSC-Domain:

Domain property
===============

A domain property in Search Console tracks all versions of your website, including subdomains and
protocols (http/https). This comprehensive view allows you to analyze your overall website's search
performance and make informed decisions to optimize its visibility. Enter the domain, e.g.,
`example.com` and click :guilabel:`Continue`.

.. note::
   - The domain property type can only be verified via
     `DNS record <https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9008080?hl=en#domain_name_verification&zippy=%2Chtml-tag>`_.
   - Google suggests creating at least one domain property to represent your site, as it is the most
     complete view of your website information.

.. _GSC-URL prefix:

URL prefix property
===================

This type of verification is usually simpler as you have multiple verification methods, such as
using your existing Google Analytics or Tag Manager account. It also makes sense to view a section
of your website separately. For example, if you work with a consultant on a specific part of your
website, you might want to verify this part separately to limit access to your data. Enter the URL,
e.g., `https://example.odoo.com/` and click :guilabel:`Continue`.


Site ownership verification
===========================

Before using Google Search Console for your website, you must verify your site ownership. This
verification process is a security measure that protects both you and Google. It ensures that only
authorized users have access to sensitive data and that you have control over how your website is
treated in Google Search.

Five methods are available to do this:

.. _website/google-search-console:

#. :ref:`GSC-HTML-file-upload`
#. `DNS record <https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9008080?hl=en#domain_name_verification&zippy=%2Chtml-tag>`_
#. `HTML tag <https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9008080?hl=en#meta_tag_verification&zippy=%2Chtml-tag>`_
#. `Google Analytics tracking code <https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9008080?hl=en#google_analytics_verification>`_
#. `Google Tag Manager container snippet <https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9008080?hl=en#google_tag_manager_verification>`_

.. note::
   The best method for you depends on your comfort level and technical expertise. For beginners,
   using a file upload or HTML tag might be easiest. Those options are convenient if you already use
   :ref:`Google Analytics <analytics/google-analytics>` or :ref:`Google Tag Manager
   <analytics/google-tag-manager>`. You need to access your domain registrar's settings for domain
   verification.

.. _GSC-HTML-file-upload:

HTML file upload
----------------

This method involves uploading an HTML file provided by Google containing the verification code you
have to put in your Odoo's Website Settings. Google verifies ownership by checking for this code.

#. Once you added your website URL under the URL prefix option and clicked :guilabel:`continue`,
   expand the HTML file section where you find a download :icon:`fa-download` button.

   .. image:: google_search_console/html-file-download.png
      :alt: HTML file download

#. Download your HTML verification file and copy the verification code (e.g., `google123abc.html`).

   .. image:: google_search_console/open-copy-html-file.png
      :alt: Open and copy html file

#. In your Odoo database, go to :menuselection:`Website --> Configuration --> Settings`,
   and enable :guilabel:`Google Search Console` in the :guilabel:`SEO` section. Paste the
   verification code (e.g., `google123abc.html`) in the dedicated field.

   .. image:: google_search_console/paste-html-code-settings.png
      :alt: Paste html code in Odoo

#. In Google Search Console, click :guilabel:`Verify`. If you perform the steps above correctly,
   verification should be done immediately.

.. _website/google_search_console/HTML-tag:

HTML tag
--------

This method involves copying a meta tag provided by Google and pasting it into your Odoo website.
To verify your site ownership using an HTML tag, follow these instructions:

#. Expand the HTML tag section.

   .. image:: google_search_console/gsc-html-tag.png
      :alt: Open HTML tag section.

#. :guilabel:`Copy` the HTML tag to clipboard.
#. On your Odoo website, click :guilabel:`Edit` in the upper-right corner, go to
   the :guilabel:`Theme` tab, scroll down to the :guilabel:`Advanced` section, then
   click :guilabel:`<head> and </body>` next to :guilabel:`Code Injection`.
   Paste the copied tag into the first field (:guilabel:`<head>`), and click :guilabel:`Save`.

   .. image:: google_search_console/gsc-paste-tag.png

Mail groups
===========

The **mail groups** feature allows website visitors to have a public discussion by email. They can
join a group to receive emails from other group members (i.e., website users who have subscribed to
the group) and send new ones to all group members.

To activate the feature, :ref:`install <general/install>` the :guilabel:`Website Mail Group`
(`website_mail_group`) module.

.. note::
   The **mail groups** feature is not to be confused with the
   :doc:`../../marketing/email_marketing/mailing_lists` in the Email Marketing app.

.. _website/mailing_lists/configure_groups:

Configuring mail groups
=======================

To configure mail groups, proceed as follows:

#. Configure a custom email alias domain by accessing the **General settings**, scrolling down to
   the :guilabel:`Discuss` section, enabling the :guilabel:`Custom Email Server` feature, and
   entering the :guilabel:`Alias domain` (e.g., `@mycompany.com`).
#. Go to :menuselection:`Website --> Configuration --> Mailing Lists`, then click :guilabel:`New`.
#. Specify a :guilabel:`Group Name`, the :guilabel:`Email Alias`, and a :guilabel:`Description`.
#. Enable :guilabel:`Moderate this group` and specify the :guilabel:`Moderators` if you wish to
   :ref:`moderate messages <website/mailing_lists/moderate>` from this group. Alternatively, if the
   group is not moderated, you can define :guilabel:`Responsible Users` who can manage the messages
   in the group.
#. In the :guilabel:`Privacy` tab, define who can subscribe to the mail group:

   - :guilabel:`Everyone`: to make the mail group public so anyone can subscribe to it;
   - :guilabel:`Members only`: to only allow users defined as members to subscribe to the mail group;
   - :guilabel:`Selected group of users`: to only allow users from the :guilabel:`Authorized group`
     to subscribe to the mail group.

#. If the mail group is moderated, you can automatically notify authors when their message is
   pending moderation by enabling :guilabel:`Automatic notification` in the :guilabel:`Notify
   Members` tab and writing the :guilabel:`Notification message`.
#. If you wish to send out guidelines to new subscribers, enable :guilabel:`Send guidelines to new
   subscribers` and write them in the :guilabel:`Guidelines` tab. This is particularly useful when
   the mail group is moderated.

Using mail groups
=================

Subscribing/unsubscribing
-------------------------

Based on the :ref:`configuration of the mail group <website/mailing_lists/configure_groups>`,
users can subscribe to and unsubscribe from mail groups from the website page (`/groups` by default).

.. image:: mail_groups/mail-group-page.png
   :alt: Mail group web page.

Internal users can also do this from :menuselection:`Website --> Configuration --> Mailing Lists`,
using the :guilabel:`Join` and :guilabel:`Leave` buttons.

Sending messages
----------------

To send messages to a mail group, website users can email the :ref:`mail group's email address
<website/mailing_lists/configure_groups>`. Internal users can also create messages directly from
Odoo. To do so, go to :menuselection:`Website --> Configuration --> Mailing Lists`, select the mail
group, click the :guilabel:`Emails` smart button, and click :guilabel:`New`. Then, fill in the
fields and click :guilabel:`Send`.

.. tip::
   - The list of messages can also be accessed by selecting the group from the `/groups` website
     page.
   - Group members can also unsubscribe from the group, access the mail group page, and send emails
     to the group using the URLs in the footer of any group email they have received.

     .. image:: mail_groups/mail-group-URLs.png
        :alt: URLs in the footer of a group email.

.. _website/mailing_lists/moderate:

Moderating mail group messages
==============================

If the :guilabel:`Moderate this group` feature has been enabled for the
:ref:`mail group <website/mailing_lists/configure_groups>`, one of the :guilabel:`Moderators` must
approve the group's messages before they are dispatched to the other members.

To moderate messages, go to :menuselection:`Website --> Configuration --> Mailing Lists`, select the
mail group, and click the :guilabel:`To review` smart button. You can moderate messages using the
buttons at the end of the message line or select a message to view its content and moderate it
accordingly.

   .. image:: mail_groups/mail-group-moderation.png
      :alt: Moderation buttons in the message line.

The following actions are available:

- :guilabel:`Accept`: to accept the email and send it to the mail group members.
- :guilabel:`Reject`: to reject the email. In the pop-up window that opens, click
  :guilabel:`Reject Silently` to reject the email without notifying the author, or specify an
  explanation for rejecting the message, then click :guilabel:`Send & Reject` to reject the message
  and send the explanation to the author.
- :guilabel:`Whitelist`: to whitelist the author, i.e. automatically accept all of their emails. As
  a result, a :ref:`moderation rule <website/mailing_lists/moderate>` is created for the author's
  email address with the status :guilabel:`Always allow`.
- :guilabel:`Ban`: to blacklist the author, i.e. automatically discard all their emails. In the
  pop-up window that opens, click :guilabel:`Ban` to ban the author without notifying them, or
  specify an explanation, then click :guilabel:`Send & Ban` to ban the author and send them the
  explanation. As a result, a :ref:`moderation rule <website/mailing_lists/moderate>` is created for
  the author's email address with the status :guilabel:`Permanent ban`.

.. note::
   Messages can also be moderated from the group's list of messages. Go to :menuselection:`Website
   --> Groups --> Mailing List Groups`, select the mail group and click the :guilabel:`Emails` smart
   button.

.. _website/mailing_lists/moderation_rules:

Whitelisting/Blacklisting authors
=================================

You can whitelist or blacklist an author either directly :ref:`from a mail group message
<website/mailing_lists/moderate>`, or by creating a moderation rule. To do so, go to
:menuselection:`Website --> Configuration --> Moderation Rules` and click :guilabel:`New`. Then,
select the :guilabel:`Group`, specify the author's :guilabel:`Email` and set the :guilabel:`Status`
field.

.. tip::
   You can also access the mail group's moderation rules by going to :menuselection:`Website -->
   Configuration --> Mailing Lists`, selecting the group, then clicking the :guilabel:`Moderations`
   smart button.


==================================================
SECTION: multi_website.rst
PATH: applications/websites/website/configuration/multi_website.rst
==================================================

=================
Multiple websites
=================

Odoo allows you to create multiple websites from the same database. This can be useful, for example,
if you have multiple brands operating under your organization, or to create separate websites for
different products/services, or different audiences. In these cases, having different websites can
help avoid confusion and make it easier to tailor your digital outreach strategies and reach your
target audience.

Each website can be designed and configured independently with its own :doc:`domain name
<domain_names>`, :doc:`theme <../web_design/themes>`, :doc:`pages <../structure/pages>`, :doc:`menus
<../structure/header_footer>`, :doc:`languages <translate>`, :doc:`products
<../../ecommerce/products>`, assigned sales team, etc. They can also
:ref:`share content and pages <multi-website/website_content>`.

.. tip::
   Duplicate content (i.e., pages and content shared between multiple websites) can have a negative
   impact on :doc:`../structure/seo`.

Website creation
================

To create a new website, proceed as follows:

#. Go to :menuselection:`Website --> Configuration --> Settings`.
#. Click :guilabel:`+ New Website`.

   .. image:: multi_website/create-website.png
      :alt: New website button

#. Specify the :guilabel:`Website Name` and :guilabel:`Website domain`. Each website must be
   published under its own :doc:`domain <domain_names>`.
#. Adapt the :guilabel:`Company name`, :guilabel:`Languages` and :guilabel:`Default language`
   if needed.
#. Click the :guilabel:`Create` button.

You can then start building your new website.

.. note::
   By default, all website-related apps that you have installed (e.g. **eCommerce**,
   **Forum**, **Blog**, etc.) and their related website pages are also available on the
   new website. You can remove them by amending the website's menu.

Switching websites
==================

To switch from one website to another, click the menu next to the :guilabel:`+New` button in the
top right corner and select the website you want to switch to.

.. image:: multi_website/switch-websites.png
   :alt: Website selector

.. note::
   When you switch websites, you are redirected to the homepage of the other website.

Website-specific configuration
==============================

Most website settings are website-specific, which means they can be enabled/disabled per website. To
adapt the settings for a website, go to :menuselection:`Website --> Configuration --> Settings`.
Select the desired website in the field :guilabel:`Settings of Website` at the top of the
:guilabel:`Settings` page, in the **yellow** banner. Then, adapt the options for that specific
website.

.. note::
   - Websites are created with the default settings; the settings are not copied from one website to
     the other.
   - In a :doc:`multi-company environment </applications/general/companies>`, each website can be
     linked to a specific company in your database so that only company-related data (e.g.,
     products, jobs, events, etc.) is displayed on the website. To display company-specific data,
     set the desired company in the :guilabel:`Company` field.

.. _multi-website/website_content:

Content availability
--------------------

By default, pages, products, events, etc. created from the frontend (using the
:guilabel:`+New` button) are only available on the website from which it was created. Records
created from the backend, however, are made available on all websites by default. The content's
availability can be changed in the backend, in the :guilabel:`Website` field. For example, for
products, go to :menuselection:`eCommerce --> Products`, then select the product and go to the
:guilabel:`Sales` tab. For forums, go to :menuselection:`Configuration --> Forums`, then select the
forum.

.. image:: multi_website/forum-multi-website.png
   :alt: Website field in Forum form

.. _website_field:

Records and features can be made available:

- On all websites: leave the :guilabel:`Website` field empty;
- Only on one website: set the :guilabel:`Website` field accordingly;
- On some websites: in this case, you should duplicate the item and set the :guilabel:`Website`
  field.

Website pages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To modify the website on which a page is to be published, proceed as follows:

#. Go to :menuselection:`Website --> Site --> Pages`.
#. Open the search panel and select the website on which the page is currently published.

   .. image:: multi_website/pages-switch-websites.png
      :alt: Display pages per website

#. Tick the check box next to the page(s) you want to change.
#. Click the :guilabel:`Website` field and select the website, or empty it to publish the page on
   all websites.

.. note::
   Each website must have its own homepage; you may not use the same homepage for several websites.

eCommerce features
==================

eCommerce features such as products, eCommerce categories, pricelists, discounts, payment providers,
etc. can be restricted to :ref:`a specific website <website_field>`.

Customer accounts
-----------------

You can :doc:`allow your customers to use the same account
<../../ecommerce/customer_accounts>` on all of your websites by enabling the :guilabel:`Shared
Customer Accounts` check box in the website settings.

Pricing
-------

Products can be priced differently based on the website using :ref:`pricelists
<ecommerce/prices/selectable-pricelists>`. The following configuration is required:

#. Go to :menuselection:`Website --> Configuration --> Settings`.
#. Scroll down to the :guilabel:`Shop - Products` section and select the :guilabel:`Pricelists`
   option :guilabel:`Multiple prices per product`.
#. Click :guilabel:`Pricelists` to define new pricelists or edit existing ones.
#. Select the pricelist or click :guilabel:`New` to create a new one, then select the
   :guilabel:`Configuration` tab and set the :guilabel:`Website` field.

Reporting
=========

Analytics
---------

Each website has its own :ref:`analytics <analytics/plausible>`. To switch between websites, click
the buttons in the upper right corner.

.. image:: multi_website/analytics-switch-websites.png
   :alt: Switch websites in analytics

Other reporting data
--------------------

Odoo allows you to create pages for your website and customize their content and appearance to your
needs.

.. _website/pages/page_type:

**Static** pages, such as the homepage or any :ref:`custom-created <website/pages/page_creation>`,
contain fixed content that does not change dynamically. You can manually create these pages, define
their URLs, and adapt their :ref:`properties <website/pages/page_management>` as needed. **Dynamic**
pages, on the other hand, are generated dynamically. All pages generated automatically by Odoo, for
example, when you install an app or module (e.g., `/shop` or `/blog`) or publish a new product or
:doc:`blog post <../../blog>`, are dynamic pages and are therefore managed differently.

.. _website/pages/page_creation:

Page creation
=============

Website pages can be created from the **frontend** and the **backend**. To create a new website
page, proceed as follows:

  #. - Either open the **Website** app, click :guilabel:`+ New` in the top-right corner, then select
       :guilabel:`Page`;
     - Or go to :menuselection:`Website --> Site --> Pages` and click :guilabel:`New`.
  #. In the :guilabel:`New Page` selection menu, click on a template. They are sorted by type:

     - :guilabel:`Basic`: Multi-purpose page. A blank page is also available to start from scratch.
     - :guilabel:`About`: Information about your brand.
     - :guilabel:`Landing Pages`: Summary of company content and info.
     - :guilabel:`Gallery`: Photos and media showcase.
     - :guilabel:`Services`: Focus on what you're selling and contact.
     - :guilabel:`Pricing Plans`: Highlight on subscription and prices.
     - :guilabel:`Team`: The people behind your company.
     - :guilabel:`Custom`: To select a custom template. To add a template to this category, open the
       page you want to save as a template, then go to :menuselection:`Site --> Properties`, enter
       the :guilabel:`Page Title`, :ref:`edit the page's properties
       <website/pages/page_properties>`, enable :guilabel:`Is a template`, and click
       :guilabel:`Save`.

  #. Enter a :guilabel:`Page Title`; this title is used in the menu and the page's URL.
  #. Click :guilabel:`Create`.

-----------------------------

Pages need to be published to make them visible to website visitors. To publish or unpublish a
page, access it and toggle the switch in the upper-right corner from :guilabel:`Unpublished`
to :guilabel:`Published`, or vice versa.

.. image:: pages/un-published_toggle.png
   :alt: Unpublished/Published toggle

.. note::
   It is also possible to:

    - Publish/unpublish a page from the :ref:`page properties <website/pages/page_properties>`,
      where you can define a publishing date and/or restrict the page's visibility if needed;
    - Publish/unpublish several pages at once: go to :menuselection:`Website --> Site --> Pages`,
      select the pages, then click :guilabel:`Action` and select :guilabel:`Publish` or
      :guilabel:`Unpublish`.


Alternatively, you can define any :ref:`static page <website/pages/page_type>` as your homepage by
going to :menuselection:`Website --> Site --> Properties`. Select the :guilabel:`Publish` tab and
enable :guilabel:`Use as Homepage`.

.. _website/pages/page_properties:

Page properties
---------------

To modify a :ref:`static page's <website/pages/page_type>` properties, access the page you wish to
modify, then go to :menuselection:`Site --> Properties`, where you can change the following
properties:

 - :guilabel:`Page URL` : Modify the page URL in the field. In this case, you can redirect the
   old URL to the new one if needed. To do so, enable :guilabel:`Redirect old URL`, then select the
   :guilabel:`Type` of :ref:`redirection <website/pages/URL-redirection>`:

    - :guilabel:`301 Moved permanently`: to redirect the page permanently.
    - :guilabel:`302 Moved temporarily`: to redirect the page temporarily.

 - :guilabel:`Visibility`: Select who can access the page:

    - :guilabel:`Public`: Everyone can access the page.
    - :guilabel:`Signed In`: Only signed-in users can access the page.
    - :guilabel:`Restricted Group`: Select the :doc:`user access group(s)
      </applications/general/users/access_rights>` in the :guilabel:`Authorized group` field.
    - :guilabel:`With Password`: Type the password required to access the page in the
      :guilabel:`Password` field.

 - :guilabel:`Is a template`: Toggle the switch to save the page as a template and add it to the
   :guilabel:`Custom`  category.

.. tip::
   *Some* of these properties can also be modified in batch from
   :menuselection:`Website --> Site --> Pages`.

.. _website/pages/duplicate-page:

Duplicating pages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To duplicate a page, access the page, then go to :menuselection:`Site --> Properties`, and click
:guilabel:`Duplicate Page`. Enter a :guilabel:`Page Name`, then click :guilabel:`OK`. By default,
the new page is added after the duplicated page in the menu, but you can remove it from the menu or
change its position using the :doc:`menu editor <header_footer>`.

.. _website/pages/delete-page:

Deleting pages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To delete a page, proceed as follows:

#. Access the page, then go to :menuselection:`Site --> Properties` and click :guilabel:`Delete Page`.
#. A pop-up window shows all links referring to the page you want to delete,
   organized by category. To ensure website visitors don't land on an error page, you must update
   all the links on your website referring to the page. To do so, expand a category, then click on a
   link to open it in a new window. Alternatively, you can set up a :ref:`redirection
   <website/pages/URL-redirection>` for the deleted page.
#. Once you have updated the links (or set up a :ref:`redirection <website/pages/URL-redirection>`),
   tick the :guilabel:`I am sure about this` check box, then click :guilabel:`OK`.

.. _website/pages/URL-redirection:

URL redirect mapping
--------------------

URL redirect mapping consists in sending visitors and search engines to a URL different from
the one they initially requested. This technique is used, for example, to prevent broken links when
you :ref:`delete a page <website/pages/delete-page>`,
:ref:`modify its URL <website/pages/page_properties>`, or migrate your site from another platform to
an Odoo :doc:`domain <../configuration/domain_names>`. It can also be used to improve :doc:`seo`.

To access existing URL redirections and create new ones, :doc:`activate the developer mode
</applications/general/developer_mode>` and go to :menuselection:`Website --> Configuration -->
Redirects`.

.. note::
   - A redirect record is added automatically every time you :ref:`modify a page's URL
     <website/pages/page_properties>` and enable :guilabel:`Redirect Old URL`.
   - You can set up redirections for :ref:`static and dynamic pages <website/pages/page_type>`.

To create a new redirection, click the :guilabel:`New` button, then fill in the fields:

- :guilabel:`Name`: Enter a name to identify the redirect.
- :guilabel:`Action`: Select the type of redirection:

   - :guilabel:`404 Not found`: visitors are redirected to a 404 error page when they try to access
     an unpublished or deleted page.
   - :guilabel:`301 Moved Permanently`: for permanent redirections of unpublished or deleted
     :ref:`static pages <website/pages/page_type>`. The new URL is shown in search engine results,
     and the redirect is cached by browsers.
   - :guilabel:`302 Moved Temporarily`: for short-term redirections, for example, if you are
     redesigning or updating a page. The new URL is neither cached by browsers nor shown in search
     engine results.
   - :guilabel:`308 Redirect/Rewrite`: for permanent redirections of existing :ref:`dynamic pages
     <website/pages/page_type>`. The URL is renamed; the new name is shown in search engine results
     and is cached by browsers. Use this redirect type to rename a dynamic page, for example, if you
     wish to rename `/shop` into `/market`.

- :guilabel:`URL from`: Enter the URL to be redirected (e.g., `/about-the-company`) or search for
  the desired :ref:`dynamic page <website/pages/page_type>` and select it from the list.
- :guilabel:`URL to`: For 301, 302, and 308 redirects, enter the URL to be redirected to. If you
  want to redirect to an external URL, include the protocol (e.g., `https://`).
- :guilabel:`Website`: Select a specific website.
- :guilabel:`Sequence`: To define the order in which redirections are performed, e.g., in the case
  of redirect chains (i.e., a series of redirects where one URL is redirected to another one, which
  is itself further redirected to another URL).

Toggle the :guilabel:`Activate` switch to deactivate the redirection.

.. important::
   404, 301, and 302 redirections are meant to migrate traffic from
   :ref:`unpublished <website/pages/un-publish-page>` or :ref:`deleted <website/pages/delete-page>` pages
   to *new* pages, while the 308 redirect is used for *permanent* redirections of *existing* pages.

Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
================================

Search Engine Optimization, often abbreviated as SEO, is a digital marketing strategy to improve a
website's visibility and ranking in search engine results (e.g., in Google). It involves optimizing
various elements on your website, including its content, social sharing, URLs, images, and page
speed.

.. note::
   - Odoo provides several modules to help you build your website content, such as
     :doc:`eCommerce <../../ecommerce>`, :doc:`Blog <../../blog>`, :doc:`eLearning
     <../../elearning>`, and :doc:`Forum <../../forum>`.
   - All Odoo :doc:`themes <../web_design/themes>` rely on the CSS Framework `Bootstrap
     <https://getbootstrap.com/>`_ to render efficiently according to the device: desktop, tablet,
     or mobile, which positively impacts ranking in search engines.

Content optimization
====================

To optimize a webpage's SEO, access the page, then go to :menuselection:`Website --> Site -->
Optimize SEO`.

.. image:: seo/optimize-seo.png
   :alt: Optimize SEO

.. note::
   If you change the title of a blog post or the name of a product, the link to the related webpage
   is automatically updated. The old link still functions as Odoo creates a
   :ref:`301 redirect <website/pages/URL-redirection>`, maintaining the SEO.

Keywords and meta tags
----------------------

There are two types of keywords in SEO, which serve different purposes.

In-text keywords
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In-text keywords appear naturally throughout a page’s visible content (titles, headings, and body
text) and help search engines determine the topic and relevance of the page. These keywords have a
real impact on ranking. They cannot be edited in the :guilabel:`optimize SEO` pop-up.

.. important::
   It is strongly recommended to only use one H1 title per page for SEO.

.. _seo/meta-tags:

Meta tags and meta keywords
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Meta tags** are HTML elements that provide information about a webpage to search engines and
website visitors. They play a crucial role in SEO by helping search engines understand the content
and context of a webpage and attract visitors with appealing content. They can be edited in the
:guilabel:`optimize SEO` pop-up. There are two types of meta tags in Odoo:

- :guilabel:`Title` tags specify a webpage's title and are displayed as a clickable link in search
  engine results. They should be concise, descriptive, and relevant to the page's content. You can
  update the title tag of your webpage or keep it empty to use the default value based on the page’s
  content.

- :guilabel:`Description` tags summarize the webpage's content, often displayed in search engine
  results below the title. They are used to encourage the user to visit the page. You can update
  the description tag of your webpage or keep it empty to use the default value based on the page’s
  content.

.. note::
   The :guilabel:`Preview` card displays how the title and description tags should appear in search
   results. It also includes the URL of your page.

**Meta keywords** are placed in a hidden HTML tag `<meta name="keywords">`. Once used to describe a
page’s topic, this tag is now ignored by major search engines and has little or no impact on SEO.
To edit :guilabel:`Keywords`, enter the keywords you consider essential in this field and click
:guilabel:`Add` to see how they are used at different levels in your content (H1, H2, page title,
page description, page content) and the related searches in Google. The tool also suggests relevant
keywords.

.. _seo/images:

Images
------

The size of images has a significant impact on page speed, which is an essential criterion for
search engines to optimize SEO ranking.

.. tip::
   Compare how your website ranks using `Google Page Speed <https://pagespeed.web.dev/?utm_source=psi&utm_medium=redirect>`_
   or `Pingdom Website Speed Test <https://tools.pingdom.com/>`_.

Odoo automatically compresses uploaded images and converts them to `Webp`. With this file format,
photos are smaller, which increases the page loading speed and, therefore, gives a better ranking in
SEO. All images used in Odoo official :doc:`themes <../web_design/themes>` are also compressed by
default. If you are using a third-party theme, it may provide images that are not compressed
efficiently.

**To modify an image** from your website, select the image, click :guilabel:`Edit`, then go to the
:guilabel:`Customize` tab, and adapt the :guilabel:`Format` in the :guilabel:`Image` section.

.. important::
   Alt tags are used to provide context to what an image is displaying, informing search engine
   crawlers and allowing them to index an image correctly. Adding alt tags keywords in the
   :guilabel:`Description` field is essential from an SEO perspective. This description is added to
   the HTML code of your image, and it is shown when the image cannot be displayed.

Image for social share
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you share your page on social media, your website logo is selected by default, but you can
search the :doc:`Unsplash image library <../../../general/integrations/unsplash>` or upload any
other image by clicking the :icon:`fa-upload` :guilabel:`(upload)` button.

.. tip::
   You can set a default social share image. Go to :menuselection:`Website --> Configuration --> Settings`
   in the :guilabel:`SEO`section and tick the :guilabel:`Default Social Share Image` checkbox.

.. note::
   - The :guilabel:`Social Preview` card displays how the page's information would appear when
     shared.

Indexation
==========

Website indexation is the process by which search engines, such as Google, discover, analyze, and
store information about a website's content in their database. Search engine bots, known as crawlers
or spiders, visit web pages and follow links to collect data, including text, images, and other
media. The purpose of indexation is to make a website's content searchable and discoverable to
users. Without being indexed, a website or a specific page on that site will not appear in search
engine results, regardless of how relevant or well-designed it is. Indexation is a fundamental step
in :abbr:`SEO (Search Engine Optimization)`, serving as the foundation for a website's visibility
and organic traffic.

.. note::
   **When you first create your website on Odoo, it will not appear directly in search engine
   results.** Search engines need time to crawl and index it, which can take anywhere from a few
   days to several weeks. For Google, you can use the :doc:`Search Console <../configuration/google_search_console>`
   and request indexing for specific URLs, though this does not guarantee faster results.
   If you have an existing website and are migrating, your previous website may still appear instead
   of the new one during that timeframe.

SEO impact when migrating your existing website to Odoo
-------------------------------------------------------

In most cases, migrating to Odoo will not negatively impact your SEO. While no platform can
guarantee that rankings will remain unchanged, follow these best practices to significantly reduce
the risk.

- Keep your existing content.

- Implement :ref:`redirects <website/pages/URL-redirection>` from old URLs to their new counterparts.

- Monitor traffic and indexation to make sure that everything is going well, using :doc:`../configuration/google_search_console`.

By doing this, you help search engines reindex your site and maintain your visibility in search
results.

.. note::
   It is normal to experience a traffic decrease in the first days.

Prevent a page from being indexed
---------------------------------

To effectively prevent a page from appearing in search engine results, use one of the following
methods:

 - **noindex tag:** Access the page's :ref:`properties <website/pages/page_properties>` and toggle
   the :guilabel:`Indexed` switch off.

   .. note::
      This option is not yet available for :ref:`dynamic pages <website/pages/page_type>`.

 - **404 or 403:** Configure the page to return a 404 (Not Found) or 403 (Forbidden) HTTP status
   code. These codes signal to search engines that the page does not exist or is inaccessible,
   leading to its eventual removal from the index.

    - **404:** :ref:`Configure a 404 redirection. <website/pages/URL-redirection>`
    - **403:** Access the page's :ref:`properties <website/pages/page_properties>`
      and toggle the :guilabel:`Visibility` switch off or :ref:`unpublish the page <website/pages/un-publish-page>`.

 - **Google Search Console:** Use Google Search Console to request the removal of specific URLs from
   Google's index.

.. seealso::
   - :doc:`../configuration/google_search_console`
   - :doc:`pages`

Prevent a website from being indexed
------------------------------------

To prevent a website from appearing in search engine results, go to
:menuselection:`Configuration --> Settings`, then in the :guilabel:`Website Info` section, add a
random value in the :guilabel:`Domain` field. Doing so automatically inserts the following tag into
the page source:

.. code-block:: html

       <meta name="robots" content="noindex"/>

This tag instructs search engines not to index the site. After applying the change, it may take
several days or weeks for search engines to update their results and remove the website.

.. example::
   This can be used to prevent websites from test databases from appearing in search results.

Sitemap
=======

The sitemap points out website pages and their relation to each other to search engine crawlers.
Odoo generates a `/sitemap.xml` file, including all URLs. For performance reasons, this file is
cached and updated every 12 hours.

.. note::
   If your website has a lot of pages, Odoo automatically creates a Sitemap Index file, respecting
   the `sitemaps.org protocol <http://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html>`_, grouping sitemap URLs in
   45000 chunks per file.

Every sitemap entry has three attributes that are computed automatically:

- `<loc>`: the URL of a page.
- `<lastmod>`: last modification date of the resource, computed automatically based on the related
  object. For a page related to a product, this could be the last modification date of the product
  or the page.
- `<priority>`: modules may implement their priority algorithm based on their content (for example,
  a forum might assign a priority based on the number of votes on a specific post). The priority of
  a static page is defined by its priority field, which is normalized (16 is the default).

.. tip::
   To prevent pages from appearing in a sitemap, go to :menuselection:`Site --> Properties`, and
   toggle off the :guilabel:`Indexed` feature.

     .. image:: seo/page-properties.png
        :alt: toggle off the “Indexed” field

robots.txt
==========

A `robots.txt` file instructs search engine crawlers which parts of a website they are permitted to
access. Its primary purpose is to:

 - **Prevent overloading the website:** By guiding crawlers away from certain sections, robots.txt
   helps manage server load.
 - **Control access to resources and detailed descriptions:** It can prevent crawlers from accessing
   media files (images, videos), CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript files, and from reading the content
   (text) of specific pages.

When indexing your website, search engines first look at the robots.txt file. Odoo automatically
creates one robot.txt file available on `mydatabase.odoo.com/robots.txt`.

.. note::
   Reputable bots adhere to robots.txt; others may require blocking via
   :ref:`Cloudflare <domain-name/naked/cloudflare>` on your custom domain.

Edit robots.txt
---------------

By editing a robots.txt file, you can control which site pages are accessible to search engine
crawlers. To add custom instructions to the file, go to :menuselection:`Website --> Configuration
--> Settings`, scroll down to the :guilabel:`SEO` section, and click :guilabel:`Edit robots.txt`.

.. example::
   If you do not want robots to crawl the `/about-us` page of your site, you can edit the
   robots.txt file to add `Disallow: /about-us`.

.. important::
   While `robots.txt` prevents content from being crawled, **it does not guarantee that a page
   will not be indexed**. A page can still appear in search results if it is linked to from other
   crawled pages (indexed by "reference"). Google generally does not recommend using robots.txt to
   block webpages that you wish to keep out of search results entirely.

Advanced features
=================

Structured data markup
----------------------

Structured data markup is used to generate rich snippets in search engine results. It is a way for
websites to send structured data to search engine crawlers, helping them understand your content and
create well-presented search results.

By default, Google supports many `rich snippets <https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2009/05/introducing-rich-snippets>`_
for content types, including Reviews, People, Products, Businesses, Events, and Organizations.

Microdata is a set of tags, introduced with HTML5, that help search engines better understand your
content and display it in a relevant way. Odoo implements microdata as defined in the schema.org
`specification <https://schema.org/docs/gs.html>`_ for events, eCommerce products, forum posts, and
contact addresses. This allows your product pages to be displayed in Google using extra information
like the price and rating of a product:

.. image:: seo/rich-snippet.png
   :alt: snippets in search engine results

Hreflang HTML tags
------------------

Odoo automatically includes `hreflang` and `x-default` tags in the code of your website's
multilingual pages. These HTML attributes are crucial in informing search engines about a specific
page's language and geographical targeting.

Theme
=====

In the :guilabel:`Website` section, click on :guilabel:`Switch Theme` to open the theme selector.
Hover your mouse over the themes to see an extended preview of each one. Click on a theme to apply
it to your website.

.. _website/themes/colors:

Colors
======

Odoo's website editor features two main types of colors: :ref:`theme colors <website/themes/theme-colors>`
and :ref:`status colors <website/themes/status-colors>`.

.. _website/themes/theme-colors:

Theme colors
------------

Theme colors refer to the set of colors displayed across all pages of your website. These are made
of five colors: three main colors and two light and dark colors.

To edit your website's colors, go to the :guilabel:`Colors` section in the website editor, then:

- Click on the color dot you want to change, then select a :guilabel:`Solid` color or click on
  :guilabel:`Custom` to pick a specific color tone manually (or add its #HEX or RGBA code).
- Click on the paint palette icon and choose a color palette. As a result, all color customizations
  are reset; click a color dot to change a specific color.

Odoo automatically creates :guilabel:`Color Presets` for your chosen palette. These are predefined
color combinations applied to different elements of your website to provide a structured and
visually appealing design. When you select a color palette, its presets define how those colors are
distributed across different elements from a building block, such as buttons, backgrounds, and text.
If you want to modify them, click on :guilabel:`Color Presets` and click on a preset to customize it
further. Each color preset contains colors for your building block’s background, text, headings,
links, primary buttons, and secondary buttons.

.. image:: themes/color-presets.png
   :scale: 80%
   :alt: Color presets

To apply a color preset to a building block on your site, select the building block, go to the
:guilabel:`Customize` tab, click the color dot located next to :guilabel:`Background`, and choose a
:guilabel:`Theme`.

.. note::
   Changing a color preset automatically updates the colors of both the default preset and the
   building blocks where the preset is used.

.. _website/themes/status-colors:

Status colors
-------------

Status colors are used to indicate the status of certain actions (e.g., :guilabel:`Success`,
:guilabel:`Warning`, etc.). They're used in pop-up messages that appear to provide feedback to
users and website visitors. To customize your website's :guilabel:`Status Colors`, scroll down to
the :guilabel:`Advanced` section and click on the dots to change their color.

.. example::
   .. image:: themes/advanced.png

.. _website/themes/page-layouts:

Page layout
===========

The :guilabel:`Page layout` option in the :guilabel:`Website` section allows you to change the
overall display and spacing of building blocks and website elements on pages. Click the dropdown
menu and select the desired layout. Under :guilabel:`Page Layout`, customize your
:guilabel:`Background` by choosing an :guilabel:`Image`, using a selected image in a
:guilabel:`Pattern`, or leaving it blank.

.. _website/themes/fonts:

Fonts
=====

Odoo allows you to customize the font family and size for specific elements on your website,
including paragraphs, headings, buttons, and input fields.

- :guilabel:`Font Family`: In the :guilabel:`Paragraph`, :guilabel:`Headings`, and
  :guilabel:`Button` sections, select a font from the dropdown menu.

- :guilabel:`Font Size`: In the :guilabel:`Paragraph`, :guilabel:`Headings`, :guilabel:`Button`, and
  :guilabel:`Input Fields` sections, use the :guilabel:`Font Size` field to set a default size.
  Click the :icon:`fa-caret-right` (arrow) icon to expand the section and define custom sizes
  (e.g., based on the heading level, button size, etc.).

Additionally, each element-specific section offers extra styling options, such as
:guilabel:`Line Height` and :guilabel:`Margins`, for further customization.

Custom fonts
------------

It is possible to use fonts on your website that are not offered by default in Odoo. To add a custom
font, click the dropdown menu related to the :guilabel:`Font Family` field and select :guilabel:`Add
a Custom Font` at the bottom of the dropdown menu. In the pop-up window:

- To add a Google font, click on :guilabel:`Select a Google Font` and click on the desired font
  in the list. Toggle off the :guilabel:`Serve font from Google servers` if your website is operated
  from a location where regulations require compliance with laws such as, but not limited to, the
  European Union's GDPR. This will ensure that the Google Font is stored on your website's server
  instead of Google's.
- To upload a custom font from your computer, click on :guilabel:`Choose File`.

Once done, click on :guilabel:`Save and Reload`.

.. _website/themes/button-styles:

Button styles
=============

To customize the style of your website's primary and secondary buttons, navigate to the
:guilabel:`Button` section in the website editor and edit the relevant options:

- Click the arrow next to the :guilabel:`Primary Style` or :guilabel:`Secondary Style` fields and
  select one of the available styles for each type of button: :guilabel:`Fill`, :guilabel:`Outline`,
  or :guilabel:`Flat`. When selecting :guilabel:`Outline`, the :guilabel:`Border Width` option
  appears below, allowing you to adjust the width of the button's outline.
- :ref:`Modify the fonts <website/themes/fonts>`.
- Adjust the :guilabel:`Padding` to change the size of the spacing (in pixels) around the buttons'
  labels.
- Customize the buttons' border radius using the :guilabel:`Round Corners` option.
- Add an animation when a button is clicked in the :guilabel:`On Click Effect` dropdown menu.

Translations
============

Your website can be translated into multiple languages, allowing visitors to view its content in
their preferred language.

Configuration
=============

Before translating a website into one or more languages, :doc:`install them on the database
<../../../general/users/language>`. To do so:

- Go to :menuselection:`Website --> Configuration --> Settings`.
- Under the :guilabel:`General` section, click :icon:`oi-arrow-right` :guilabel:`Install new
  languages`.
- In the dialog box, select one or more :guilabel:`Languages` from the dropdown menu, click
  :guilabel:`Add`, then :guilabel:`Close`.

Next, add the installed language(s) to the website by selecting them under the :guilabel:`Languages`
field and clicking :guilabel:`Save`.

.. tip::
   To remove a language from a website, click the :icon:`oi-close` :guilabel:`(Delete)` icon next to
   it.

.. _translate/language-selector:

Language selector
=================

Once another language is added to a website, the language selector is displayed in the website's
header and footer, allowing visitors to switch between languages.

.. tip::
   - Refresh your browser if the language selector or a language option does not appear.
   - If the visitor's browser language is not available, the website will use the website's default
     language. To edit it, go to :menuselection:`Website --> Configuration --> Settings`. Under the
     :guilabel:`General` section, select the language using the :guilabel:`Default` field.

To hide or customize the appearance of one of the language selectors, open the website in the
default language, click :guilabel:`Edit`, then select the language selector.

- To edit the header's language selector:

  #. In the sidebar, scroll down to the :guilabel:`Language Selector` section.
  #. Set the :guilabel:`Style` to :guilabel:`Dropdown` or :guilabel:`Inline`.
  #. Set the :guilabel:`Label` to :guilabel:`Text`, :guilabel:`Flag`, :guilabel:`Flag and Text`,
     :guilabel:`Code`, or :guilabel:`Flag and Code`.
  #. Click :guilabel:`Save`.

  .. tip::
     To hide the language selector in the header, go to the :guilabel:`Show/Hide Elements` section
     and click the :icon:`fa-flag` (:guilabel:`Language selector`) button next to the
     :guilabel:`Actions` field.

- To edit the footer's language selector:

  #. Set the :guilabel:`Language selector` field to :guilabel:`Dropdown`, :guilabel:`Inline`,
     or :guilabel:`None`.
  #. Set the :guilabel:`Label` to :guilabel:`Text`, :guilabel:`Flag`, :guilabel:`Flag and Text`,
     :guilabel:`Code`, or :guilabel:`Flag and Code`.
  #. Click :guilabel:`Save`.

.. tip::
   You can :ref:`display or hide website elements <website/visibility/conditions>` based on the
   website's language.

.. _translate/translate:

Translate a page
================

To translate a website page, switch to the language to translate and click :menuselection:`Edit -->
Translate` in the top-right corner to activate the translation mode.

.. note::
   - In this mode, only translatable text can be edited. Any other type of modification with the
     website builder must be carried out while using the default language.
   - Depending on the language added, some default content may already be translated. However, the
     content you added manually should be translated using the :guilabel:`Translate` feature.
   - When text is highlighted in green, it indicates that it has already been translated (manually
     or automatically). When text is highlighted in yellow, it indicates that it has not been
     translated.

Click the green button next to the :guilabel:`Translated to` field to automatically translate all
text highlighted in yellow. You can also manually translate or adapt text, whether it is highlighted
in green or yellow, by selecting it and editing it. Click :guilabel:`Save` when you are done
translating.

.. image:: translate/text-translation.png
   :alt: Entering the translation mode

.. tip::
   - The core URL structure remains consistent across languages, while specific elements like
     product names or categories are translated. For example,
     `https://www.mywebsite.com/shop/product/my-product-1` is the default version of a product page,
     while `https://www.mywebsite.com/fr/shop/product/mon-produit-1` is the translated version of
     the same product page. The structure (`/shop/product/`) remains unchanged, but the product name
     (`my-product`) is translated (`mon-produit`).
   - Some elements can also be translated from the backend (e.g., product names).

Translate SEO-related elements
------------------------------

To translate an :ref:`image's alt tag <seo/images>` (i.e., the image's :guilabel:`Description`
field) and title tag (i.e., the image's :guilabel:`Tooltip` field), switch to the language to
translate, click :menuselection:`Edit --> Translate`, and select the image. In the
:guilabel:`Translate Attribute` box, enter the translation for the :guilabel:`alt` and/or the
:guilabel:`title` tags.

To add translated :ref:`meta tags <seo/meta-tags>`, go to :menuselection:`Website --> Site -->
Optimize SEO`. In the :guilabel:`Keywords` section, select the language and add the keywords.

.. note::
   When viewing a website in its default language, all keywords are displayed, regardless of their
   language. However, when viewing a website in another language, only the keywords relevant to that

To toggle the visibility of a building block based on the visitor's device type:

- Open the website editor and select a block.
- In the :guilabel:`Customize` tab, under the block's customization options, look for
  :guilabel:`Visibility`.

  - Click the |desktop icon| (:guilabel:`Show/Hide on Desktop`) button to hide
    the block for users visiting your website from a computer.
  - Click the |mobile icon| (:guilabel:`Show/Hide on Mobile`) button to hide the block
    for users visiting your website from a mobile device.

- Click :guilabel:`Save` to apply the changes.

It is also sometimes possible to hide elements within blocks. It is mostly used to hide specific
elements inside blocks that may be too wide to be correctly displayed on mobile devices. To see if
the option is available, select an element within a block and look for the :guilabel:`Visibility`
option under the element's customization option.

.. example::
   The selected image is hidden on mobile devices.

To access the country, website language, UTM parameters, and login state conditions:

- Open the website editor and select a building block.
- In the :guilabel:`Customize` tab, look for :guilabel:`Visibility`.
- Click :guilabel:`No condition` and select :guilabel:`Conditionally` instead to display the
  different options:

  - :guilabel:`Country`: the country of the visitor's IP address.
  - :guilabel:`Languages`: the website language used by the visitor.

    .. note::
       This option is only available if more than one :doc:`language is installed
       <../configuration/translate>`.

  - :guilabel:`UTM Campaign`: the selected campaign.
  - :guilabel:`UTM Medium`: the selected medium of any campaign.
  - :guilabel:`UTM Source`: the selected source of any campaign.
  - :guilabel:`Users`: select whether the visitor should be :guilabel:`Logged In` or
    :guilabel:`Logged Out` to view the block. By default, the option is set to :guilabel:`Visible
    for Everyone`.

- For one or more of the first five options, choose if the block should be :guilabel:`Visible for`
  or :guilabel:`Hidden for`, then click :guilabel:`Choose a record...` and select it.

.. tip::
   - You can select multiple records for each option by clicking :guilabel:`Choose a record...`
     again.
   - Click the :icon:`fa-minus` (:guilabel:`remove`) button to remove an option.

Click :guilabel:`Save` to apply the changes.

.. example::
   A block with the following configuration will only be displayed to visitors with a Belgian IP
   address, for which the website is displayed in French, unless they visit the page using the
   `Sales` campaign tracked URL.

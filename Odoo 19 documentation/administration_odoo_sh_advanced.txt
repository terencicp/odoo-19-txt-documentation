Containers
==========

Overview
========

Each build is isolated within its own container (Linux namespaced container).

The base is an Ubuntu system, where all of Odoo's required dependencies,
as well as common useful packages, are installed.

If your project requires additional Python dependencies, or more recent releases,
you can define a :file:`requirements.txt` file in the root of your branches listing them.
The platform will take care to install these dependencies in your containers.
`The pip requirements specifiers <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#requirement-specifiers>`_
documentation can help you write a :file:`requirements.txt` file.
To have a concrete example,
check out the `requirements.txt file of Odoo <{GITHUB_PATH}/requirements.txt>`_.

The :file:`requirements.txt` files of submodules are taken into account as well. The platform
looks for :file:`requirements.txt` files in each folder containing Odoo modules: Not in the module folder itself,
but in their parent folder.

Directory structure
===================

As the containers are Ubuntu based, their directory structure follows the linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard.
`Ubuntu's filesystem tree overview <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LinuxFilesystemTreeOverview#Main_directories>`_
explains the main directories.

Here are the Odoo.sh pertinent directories:

::

  .
  ├── home
  │    └── odoo
  │         ├── src
  │         │    ├── odoo                Odoo Community source code

       │         └── dist-packages       Python 2.7 standard libraries
       │    ├── python3
       │         └── dist-packages       Python 3 standard libraries
       │    └── python3.5
       │         └── dist-packages       Python 3.5 standard libraries
       ├── local
       │    └── lib
       │         ├── python2.7
       │         │    └── dist-packages  Python 2.7 third-party libraries
       │         └── python3.5
       │              └── dist-packages  Python 3.5 third-party libraries
       └── usr
            └── bin
                 ├── python2.7           Python 2.7 executable
                 └── python3.5           Python 3.5 executable

Both Python 2.7 and 3.5 are installed in the containers. However:

* If your project is configured to use Odoo 10.0, the Odoo server runs with Python 2.7.
* If your project is configured to use Odoo 11.0 or above, the Odoo server runs with Python 3.5.

Database shell
==============

While accessing a container with the shell, you can access the database using *psql*.

.. code-block:: bash

  odoo@odoo-addons-master-1.odoo.sh:~$ psql
  psql (9.5.2, server 9.5.11)
  SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.2, cipher: ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384, bits: 256, compression: off)
  Type "help" for help.

  odoo-addons-master-1=>

**Be careful !**
`Use transactions <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-begin.html>`_ (*BEGIN...COMMIT/ROLLBACK*)
for every *sql* statements leading to changes
(*UPDATE*, *DELETE*, *ALTER*, ...), especially for your production database.

The transaction mechanism is your safety net in case of mistake.
You simply have to rollback your changes to revert your database to its previous state.

For example, it may happen that you forget to set your *WHERE* condition.

.. code-block:: sql

  odoo-addons-master-1=> BEGIN;
  BEGIN
  odoo-addons-master-1=> UPDATE res_users SET password = '***';
  UPDATE 457
  odoo-addons-master-1=> ROLLBACK;
  ROLLBACK

In such a case, you can rollback to revert the unwanted changes that you just mistakenly did, and rewrite the statement:

.. code-block:: sql

  odoo-addons-master-1=> BEGIN;
  BEGIN
  odoo-addons-master-1=> UPDATE res_users SET password = '***' WHERE id = 1;
  UPDATE 1
  odoo-addons-master-1=> COMMIT;
  COMMIT

However, do not forget to either commit or rollback your transaction after having done it.
Open transactions may lock records in your tables
and your running database may wait for them to be released. It can cause a server to hang indefinitely.

In addition, when possible, use your staging databases to test your statements first. It gives you an extra safety net.

Run an Odoo server
==================

You can start an Odoo server instance from a container shell. You won't be able to access it from the outside world
with a browser, but you can for instance:

* use the Odoo shell,

.. code-block:: bash

  $  odoo-bin shell
  >>> partner = env['res.partner'].search([('email', '=', 'asusteK@yourcompany.example.com')], limit=1)
  >>> partner.name
  'ASUSTeK'
  >>> partner.name = 'Odoo'
  >>> env['res.partner'].search([('email', '=', 'asusteK@yourcompany.example.com')], limit=1).name
  'Odoo'

* install a module,

.. code-block:: bash

  $  odoo-bin -i sale --stop-after-init

* update a module,

.. code-block:: bash

  $  odoo-bin -u sale --stop-after-init

* run the tests for a module,

.. code-block:: bash

  $  odoo-bin -i sale --test-enable --log-level=test --stop-after-init

In the above commands, the argument:

* ``--stop-after-init`` will immediately shutdown the server instance after it completed the operations you asked.

More options are available and detailed in the
:doc:`CLI documentation </developer/reference/cli>`.

You can find in the logs (*~/logs/odoo.log*) the addons path used by Odoo.sh to run your server.
Look for "*odoo: addons paths*":

::

  2018-02-19 10:51:39,267 4 INFO ? odoo: Odoo version {BRANCH}
  2018-02-19 10:51:39,268 4 INFO ? odoo: Using configuration file at /home/odoo/.config/odoo/odoo.conf
  2018-02-19 10:51:39,268 4 INFO ? odoo: addons paths: ['/home/odoo/data/addons/{BRANCH}', '/home/odoo/src/user', '/home/odoo/src/enterprise', '/home/odoo/src/themes', '/home/odoo/src/odoo/addons', '/home/odoo/src/odoo/odoo/addons']

**Be careful**, especially with your production database.
Operations that you perform running this Odoo server instance are not isolated:
Changes will be effective in the database. Always, make your tests in your staging databases.

Debugging in Odoo.sh
====================

Debugging an Odoo.sh build is not really different than another Python app. This article only explains the specificities and limitations of the Odoo.sh platform, and assumes that you already know how to use a debugger.

.. note:: If you don't know how to debug a Python application yet, there are multiple introductory courses that can be easily found on the Internet.

You can use ``pdb``, ``pudb`` or ``ipdb`` to debug your code on Odoo.sh.
As the server is run outside a shell, you cannot launch the debugger directly from your Odoo instance backend as the debugger needs a shell to operate.

- `pdb <https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html>`_ is installed by default in every container.

- If you want to use `pudb <https://pypi.org/project/pudb/>`_ or `ipdb <https://pypi.org/project/ipdb/>`_ you have to install it before.

  To do so, you have two options:

    - temporary (only in the current build):

      .. code-block:: bash

        $  pip install pudb --user

      or

      .. code-block:: bash

        $  pip install ipdb --user

    - permanent: add ``pudb`` or ``ipdb`` to your project ``requirements.txt`` file.


Then edit the code where you want to trigger the debugger and add this:

.. code-block:: python

  import sys
  if sys.__stdin__.isatty():
      import pdb; pdb.set_trace()

The condition :code:`sys.__stdin__.isatty()` is a hack that detects if you run Odoo from a shell.

Save the file and then run the Odoo Shell:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ odoo-bin shell

Finally, *via* the Odoo Shell, you can trigger the piece of code/function/method
you want to debug.

============================
Frequent Technical Questions
============================

"Scheduled actions do not run at the exact time they were expected"
-------------------------------------------------------------------

On the Odoo.sh platform, we cannot guarantee an exact running time for scheduled actions.

This is due to the fact that there might be multiple customers on the same server, and we must guarantee a fair share of the server for every customer. Scheduled actions are therefore implemented slightly differently than on a regular Odoo server, and are run on a *best effort* policy.

.. warning::
    Do not expect any scheduled action to be run more often than every 5 min.

Are there "best practices" regarding scheduled actions?
-------------------------------------------------------

**Odoo.sh always limits the execution time of scheduled actions (*aka* crons).**
Therefore, you must keep this fact in mind when developing your own crons.

We advise that:

- Your scheduled actions should work on small batches of records.
- Your scheduled actions should commit their work after processing each batch;
  this way, if they get interrupted by the time-limit, there is no need to start over.
- Your scheduled actions should be
  `idempotent <https://stackoverflow.com/a/1077421/3332416>`_: they must not
  cause side-effects if they are started more often than expected.

.. _ip-address-change:

How can I automate tasks when an IP address change occurs?
----------------------------------------------------------

**Odoo.sh notifies project administrators of IP address changes.**
Additionally, when the IP address of a production instance changes, an HTTP `GET` request is made
to the path `/_odoo.sh/ip-change` with the new IP address included as a query string parameter
(`new`), along with the previous IP address as an additional parameter (`old`).

This mechanism allows custom actions to be applied in response to the IP address change
(e.g., sending an email, contacting a firewall API, configuring database objects, etc.)

For security reasons, the `/_odoo.sh/ip-change` route is accessible only internally by the platform
itself and returns a `403` response if accessed through any other means.

Here is a pseudo-implementation example:

.. code-block:: python

    class IPChangeController(http.Controller):

        @http.route('/_odoo.sh/ip-change', auth='public')
        def ip_change(self, old=None, new=None):
            _logger.info("IP address changed from %s to %s", old, new)
            # Then perform whatever action required for your use case, e.g., update an
            # ir.config_parameter, send an email, contact an external firewall service's API, ...
            return 'ok'

Submodules
==========

Overview
========

A `Git submodule <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules>`_ allows you to integrate other Git projects
into your code, without the need to copy-paste all their code.

Indeed, your custom modules can depend on modules from other repositories.
Regarding Odoo, this feature allows you to add modules from other Git repositories into the branches of your repository.
Adding these dependencies in your branch through submodules makes the deployment of your code and servers easier,
as you can clone the repositories added as submodules at the same time you clone your own repository.

Besides, you can choose the branch of the repository added as submodule
and you have the control of the revision you want.
It's up to you to decide whether you want to pin the submodule to a specific revision and when you want to update
to a newer revision.

In Odoo.sh, the submodules give you the possibility to use and depend on modules available in other repositories.
The platform will detect that you added modules through submodules in your branches
and add them to your addons path automatically so you can install them in your databases.

If you add private repositories as submodules in your branches,
you need to configure a deploy key in your Odoo.sh project settings and in your repository settings.
Otherwise Odoo.sh won't be allowed to download them.
The procedure is detailed in the chapter :ref:`Settings > Submodules <odoo-sh/settings/submodules>`.

Adding a submodule
==================

With Odoo.sh (simple)
---------------------

.. warning::
   For now it is not possible to add **private** repositories with this method. You can nevertheless
   do so :ref:`with Git <odoo-sh/settings/submodules>`.

On Odoo.sh, in the branches view of your project, choose the branch in which you want to add a submodule.

In the upper right corner, click on the *Submodule* button, and then on *Run*.

.. image:: submodules/advanced-submodules-button.png
   :align: center

A dialog with a form is shown. Fill the inputs as follows:

* Repository URL: The SSH URL of the repository.
* Branch: The branch you want to use.
* Path: The folder in which you want to add this submodule in your branch.

.. image:: submodules/advanced-submodules-dialog.png
   :align: center

On Github, you can get the repository URL with the *Clone or download* button of the repository. Make sure to *use SSH*.

.. image:: submodules/advanced-submodules-github-sshurl.png
  :align: center

.. _odoosh-advanced-submodules-withgit:

With Git (advanced)
-------------------

In a terminal, in the folder where your Git repository is cloned,
checkout the branch in which you want to add a submodule:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ git checkout <branch>

Then, add the submodule using the command below:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ git submodule add -b <branch> <git@yourprovider.com>:<username/repository.git> <path>

Replace

* *<git@yourprovider.com>:<username/repository.git>* by the SSH URL of the repository you want to add as submodule,
* *<branch>* by the branch you want to use in the above repository,
* *<path>* by the folder in which you want to add this submodule.

Commit and push your changes:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ git commit -a && git push -u <remote> <branch>

Replace

* <remote> by the repository on which you want to push your changes. For a standard Git setup, this is *origin*.
* <branch> by the branch on which you want to push your changes.
  Most likely the branch you used :code:`git checkout` on in the first step.

You can read the `git-scm.com documentation <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules>`_
for more details about the Git submodules.
For instance, if you would like to update your submodules to have their latest revision,
you can follow the chapter
`Pulling in Upstream changes <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules#_pulling_in_upstream_changes_from_the_submodule_remote>`_.

Ignore modules
==============

If you're adding a repository that contains a lot of modules, you may want to ignore some of them in case there are any
that are installed automatically. To do so, you can prefix your submodule folder with a :code:`.`. The platform will
ignore this folder and you can hand pick your modules by creating symlinks to them from another folder.

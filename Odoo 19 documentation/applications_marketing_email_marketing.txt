Analyze metrics
===============

.. |CTR| replace:: :abbr:`CTR (Click through rate)`

In order to properly understand the success or failure of an email marketing campaign, it is
necessary to monitor several key metrics. The insights gained from these metrics can then be used to
optimize future campaigns. Odoo's **Email Marketing** application tracks several :ref:`key metrics
<email-marketing/view-metrics>`, that can be interpreted through :ref:`reports
<email_marketing/create_reports>` to improve future campaigns.

.. _email-marketing/view-metrics:

View metrics
============

After a mass mail has been sent, the results for that particular mailing are displayed in multiple
locations.

To access the metrics for an individual mailing, navigate to :menuselection:`Email Marketing app
--> Mailings`. Locate the specific mailing in the list view, and use the column headings to view the
results for that mailing. Click on one of the mailings in the list to open the record.

At the top of the record, detailed metrics are displayed as smart buttons.

.. image:: analyze_metrics/metric-smart-buttons.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The smart buttons on a mass mailing, displaying the results of the message.

Opened rate
-----------

The percentage of emails opened by recipients, against the total number of sent emails.

In cases where a reply is expected, such as cold outreach emails, high open rate may indicate the
subject line was timely, compelling, and successfully prompted the recipients to view the message.

In cases where a reply is not expected, such as promotional emails, it may indicate an issue with
the email, such as incorrect product links or coupon codes.

In cases where a reply is expected, a low open rate may indicate the subject
line failed to capture the recipients' interest or the message ended up in a spam or junk folder. It
could also indicate the email ended up in a spam or junk folder.

.. note::
   Emails that consistently land in recipient spam folders could be due to having a poor sender
   reputation (i.e. high unsubscribe rate, high percentage of past emails marked as spam, etc.),
   or failing to :doc:`configure the proper DNS records
   <../../general/email_communication/email_domain>`.

Replied rate
------------

The percentage of recipients who responded to the email, against the total number of sent emails.

A high replied rate may indicate the email resonated with recipients, prompting them to take
action or provide feedback.

A low replied rate may suggest the message lacked relevance or did not contain a clear
call-to-action.

Clicked rate
------------

This represents the *Clicked through rate (CTR)*, which measures the
percentage of recipients who clicked on a link within the email, against the total number of sent
emails.

A high |CTR| may indicate the email content was relevant and appropriately targeted. Recipients
were motivated to click the links provided, and likely found the content engaging.

A low |CTR| may indicate issues with either the targeting, or the content itself. Recipients may
have been unmotivated by the calls-to-action, if there were any, or the message itself may have
been directed toward the wrong audience.

Received rate
-------------

This rate measures the percentage of emails that were **successfully** delivered, against the total
number of sent emails.

A high received rate can indicate the mailing list used is up-to-date, and the sender authentication
is trusted by email providers.

A low received rate may indicate issues, either with the mailing list used for the mailing, or with
the sender authentication. View the :ref:`email-marketing/deliverability-issues` section for more
information.

Bounced rate
------------

This rate measures the percentage of emails that were **unsuccessfully** delivered, and did not
enter a recipient's inbox, against the total number of sent emails.

A high bounce rate could indicate issues, either with the mailing list used for the mailing, or with
the sender authentication.

A low bounce rate may indicate that the mailing list used is up-to-date, and the sender
authentication is trusted by email providers. View the :ref:`email-marketing/deliverability-issues`
section for more information.

.. tip::
   Click on the respective smart buttons to see all the corresponding recipient records that are
   attributed to each metric. When these filtered records are in view, multiple types of reports can
   be run for further analysis.

.. _email_marketing/create_reports:

Create metrics reports
======================

Individual metrics can be analyzed by creating a report. To begin, click on the smart button of the
desired metric.

Next, click the :icon:`fa-caret-down` :guilabel:`(down arrow)` to the right of the search bar to see
a drop-down menu of filtering and grouping parameters.

:guilabel:`Filters`, located in the left column of the search options, can be used to keep only the
results that fit the filter. For example, selecting the *Bounced* filter only shows emails
that could not be delivered.

:guilabel:`Group By`, found in the middle column, is used to organize the results into groups, and
can be used with or without filters.

.. note::
   Setting multiple :guilabel:`Group By` options creates nested groups, according to which option
   is selected first. For example, selecting :guilabel:`Sent Period`, followed by
   :guilabel:`Add Custom Group --> Responsible`, in the :guilabel:`Group By` column, sorts all
   results *first* by the sent period, *then* by the team member responsible. This is a useful
   metric for analyzing who on the team is sending in volume or quantity over a set time period.

   This can be verified by looking at the direction, and order, of the selections in the group tile
   that appears in the search bar after the selections are made.

.. example::
   A monthly newsletter has been sent out, and 6.9% of the sent emails were bounced.

   .. image:: analyze_metrics/newsletter-metrics.png
      :align: center
      :alt: The metrics smart buttons of the newsletter.

   To see what these bounced recipients have in common, the records are grouped using a custom group
   targeting :guilabel:`Mailing Lists`, which groups all records by the mailing lists they are on.
   The records are then filtered using a custom filter with the rule `Created on >= 07/01/2024
   00:00:00`, to filter by when the mailing list was last checked. This filter only includes
   recipients that have been created on, or after, July 1st, 2024, in the report.

   .. image:: analyze_metrics/metrics-filter.png
      :align: center
      :alt: The custom filter creation form.

   Using these configurations, it is evident that all the recipients with bounced emails were added
   after the list was last checked. Looking closer at the domains, it is evident that each
   recipient has a malformed email domain (i.e: @yaoo.com instead of @yahoo.com), likely due to a
   manual entry error while updating the database.

   .. image:: analyze_metrics/malformed-addresses.png
      :align: center
      :alt: A list of bounced email addresses with malformed email domains.

.. seealso::
   View :doc:`../../essentials/search` for more information about making custom groups and
   filters.

.. _email-marketing/deliverability-issues:

Mass mailing analysis
=====================

It is also possible to analyze the success between mailing campaigns by creating a *Mass Mailing
Analysis* report. To begin, navigate to :menuselection:`Email Marketing app --> Reporting --> Mass
Mailing Analysis`.

A dashboard appears displaying a bar chart containing each mailing campaign. By default,
:guilabel:`Sent` is selected, displaying the number of sent records on the y-axis. To change the
measure, click the :guilabel:`Measures` button, and select the desired measure from the drop-down
menu.

.. example::
   The following chart displays the number of opened emails from two different mass mailings.

   In this view, it can be seen that the first mass mailing led to a higher opened rate than the
   second. Because a lower opened rate can sometimes be attributed to a subject line that failed to
   capture readers' attention, the subject line of each mass mailing can be a good place to begin
   looking.

   .. image:: analyze_metrics/mma-opened.png
      :align: center
      :alt: A bar chart displaying the different opened rate between two mass mailing campaigns.

   Comparing the two subject lines, it is clear the newsletter's subject line was less engaging,
   which may have led to the lower opened rate, when compared to the other mass mailing.

   .. image:: analyze_metrics/mailing-comparison.png
      :align: center
      :alt: alt text

Deliverability issues
=====================

The following define possible reasons for a high bounce rate or low received rate:

- Using a mailing list that contains outdated contact information, or malformed email addresses are
  likely to result in a high bounce rate and/or a low received rate.
- Mailings sent using a *From* email address that differs from the sender's domain are likely to
  bounce with certain email providers due to failing :ref:`DMARC authentication
  <email-domain-dmarc>`.
- Failing to :doc:`configure the proper DNS records
  <../../general/email_communication/email_domain>` can also result in a high bounce rate.

Email marketing dashboard
=========================

After installing the application, click the :menuselection:`Email Marketing` app icon from the main
Odoo dashboard. Doing so reveals the main :guilabel:`Mailings` dashboard in the default list view.

.. image:: email_marketing/mailings-dashboard.png
   :align: center
   :alt: View of the main dashboard of the Odoo Email Marketing application.

In the search bar, the default filter of :guilabel:`My Mailings` is present to show all the mailings
related to the current user. To remove that filter, click the :guilabel:`✖️ (remove)` icon next to
the filter in the search bar. Doing so reveals all the mailings in the database.

The information on the :guilabel:`Mailings` dashboard has four different view options, located in
the upper-right corner as individual icons.

The view options, from left-to-right, are:

- :ref:`List <email_marketing/list-view>` (default view)
- :ref:`Kanban <email_marketing/kanban-view>`
- :ref:`Calendar <email_marketing/calendar-view>`
- :ref:`Graph <email_marketing/graph-view>`

.. _email_marketing/list-view:

List view
---------

The list view, represented by the :guilabel:`☰ (horizontal lines)` icon in the upper-right corner,
is the default view of the :guilabel:`Mailings` dashboard in the :guilabel:`Email Marketing` app.

While in list view, there are columns dedicated to different aspects of information related to the
listed emails. Those columns are as follows:

- :guilabel:`Date`: the date the email was sent.
- :guilabel:`Subject`: the subject of the email.
- :guilabel:`Responsible`: the user who created the email, or the user who has been assigned to the
  email.
- :guilabel:`Sent`: how many times the email has been sent.
- :guilabel:`Delivered (%)`: percentage of sent emails that have been successfully delivered.
- :guilabel:`Opened (%)`: percentage of sent emails that have been opened by the recipients.
- :guilabel:`Clicked (%)`: percentage of sent emails that have been clicked by the recipients.
- :guilabel:`Replied (%)`: percentage of sent emails that have been replied to by the recipients.
- :guilabel:`Status`: the status of the email (:guilabel:`Draft`, :guilabel:`In Queue`, or
  :guilabel:`Sent`).

To add or remove columns, click the :guilabel:`Additional Options (two horizontal lines with dots)`
icon, located to the far-right of the column titles in list view. Doing so reveals a drop-down menu
of additional column options.

.. _email_marketing/kanban-view:

Kanban view
-----------

The Kanban view, represented by the :guilabel:`(inverted bar graph)` icon, can be accessed in the
upper-right corner of the :guilabel:`Mailings` dashboard in the :guilabel:`Email Marketing` app.

.. image:: email_marketing/kanban-view.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Kanban view of the main dashboard of the Odoo Email Marketing application.

While in Kanban view, the email information is displayed in the various stages.

The stages are: :guilabel:`Draft`, :guilabel:`In Queue`, :guilabel:`Sending`, and :guilabel:`Sent`.

- :guilabel:`Draft`: the email is still being written/created.
- :guilabel:`In Queue`: the email is scheduled to be sent at a later date.
- :guilabel:`Sending`: the email is currently being sent to its recipients.
- :guilabel:`Sent`: the email has already been sent to its recipients.

In each stage, there are drag-and-drop cards representing the emails that have been created/sent,
and the stage they are in represents the current status of that mailing.

Each card on the :guilabel:`Mailings` dashboard provides key information related to that specific
email.

When the cursor hovers over the upper-right corner of an email campaign card, a :guilabel:`⋮ (three
vertical dots)` icon appears. When clicked, a mini drop-down menu reveals the option to color-code
the email, :guilabel:`Delete` the email, or :guilabel:`Archive` the message for potential future
use.

.. image:: email_marketing/three-dot-dropdown.png
   :align: center
   :alt: View of the three-dot drop-down menu on the Odoo Email Marketing dashboard.

Calendar view
-------------

The calendar view, represented by a :guilabel:`📆 (calendar)` icon, can be accessed in the
upper-right corner of the :guilabel:`Mailings` dashboard in the :guilabel:`Email Marketing` app.

While in calendar view, a monthly calendar (by default), shows when the mailings have been sent or
are scheduled to be sent.

.. image:: email_marketing/calendar-view.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Calendar view of the mailings dashboard in the Email Marketing application.

The current date is represented by a :guilabel:`🔴 (red circle)` icon over the date on the calendar.

To the right of the calendar, the options to filter the results by :guilabel:`Responsible` and/or
:guilabel:`Status` are available, via checkboxes.

.. tip::
   To hide the right sidebar, click the :guilabel:`(panel-right)` icon, located above the sidebar.

In the top-left corner, above the calendar, the option to change the time period being displayed is
available via a drop-down menu, which shows :guilabel:`Month`, by default. When clicked, the
drop-down menu that appears reveals the options: :guilabel:`Day`, :guilabel:`Week`,
:guilabel:`Month` (default), :guilabel:`Year`, and :guilabel:`Show weekends` (selected by default).

Clicking any of those options changes the calendar display to reflect that desired amount of time.

Clicking either :guilabel:`⬅️ (left arrow)` icon or :guilabel:`➡️ (right arrow)` icon changes the
calendar to a previous or future time, depending on what is clicked, based on the chosen amount of
time being represented.

To jump back to the current date, click the :guilabel:`Today` button.

.. _email_marketing/graph-view:

Graph view
----------

The graph view, represented by a :guilabel:`(line graph)` icon, can be accessed in the upper-right
corner of the :guilabel:`Mailings` dashboard in the :guilabel:`Email Marketing` app.

While in graph view, the status of the emails on the :guilabel:`Mailings` page is represented in a
bar graph, but other graph view options can be implemented, if needed.

.. image:: email_marketing/graph-view.png
   :align: center
   :alt: How the Graph view appears in the Odoo Email Marketing application.

In the upper-left corner, above the graph, there is a :guilabel:`Measures` drop-down menu. When
clicked, different filter options become available to further customize the graph views.

Those :guilabel:`Measures` options are: :guilabel:`A/B Testing percentage` and :guilabel:`Count`
(default).

To the right of the :guilabel:`Measures` drop-down menu is an :guilabel:`Insert in Spreadsheet`
button, if the *Documents* application is installed. When clicked, a pop-up window appears, in which
the ability to add the graph to a spreadsheet or dashboard becomes available.

Beside the :guilabel:`Measures` drop-down menu and :guilabel:`Insert in Spreadsheet` button are
different graph view options. From left-to-right, those graph view options are: :guilabel:`(bar
chart)` (default), :guilabel:`(line chart)`, and :guilabel:`(pie chart)`.

.. note::
   Each graph view option provides its own series of additional view options, which appear to the
   right of the selected graph view option.

Search options
--------------

Regardless of the view chosen for the :guilabel:`Mailings` dashboard in the :guilabel:`Email
Marketing` app, the :guilabel:`Filters`, :guilabel:`Group by`, and :guilabel:`Favorites` options are
always available to further customize the information being displayed.

To access those options, click the :guilabel:`(downward arrow)` icon, located to the right of the
search bar. Doing so reveals a drop-down mega menu featuring those filtering and grouping options.

.. image:: email_marketing/search-mega-menu.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The drop-down mega menu of search options the Odoo Email Marketing application.

These options provide various ways to specify and organize the information seen on the
:guilabel:`Mailings` dashboard.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Filters

      This section of the drop-down mega menu provides different ways to filter email results being
      shown on the :guilabel:`Mailings` dashboard in the :guilabel:`Email Marketing` app.

      .. image:: email_marketing/filters-dropdown.png
         :align: center
         :alt: View of filters drop-down menu options on the Odoo Email Marketing dashboard.

      The options are: :guilabel:`My Mailings`, :guilabel:`Sent Date`, :guilabel:`A/B Tests`,
      :guilabel:`A/B Tests to review`, :guilabel:`Archived`, and :guilabel:`Add Custom Filter`.

      If :guilabel:`Add Custom Filter` is selected, Odoo reveals a pop-up window, with three
      customizable fields to fill in, in order to create custom filter rules for Odoo to use to
      retrieve results that fit more specific criteria.

      .. image:: email_marketing/add-custom-filter-popup.png
         :align: center
         :alt: Add custom filter pop-up window that appears in Odoo Email Marketing app.

   .. tab:: Group By

      This section of the drop-down mega menu provides different ways to group email results being
      shown on the :guilabel:`Mailings` dashboard in the :guilabel:`Email Marketing` app.

      .. image:: email_marketing/group-by-dropdown.png
         :align: center
         :alt: View of the Group By drop-down menu on the Odoo Email Marketing application.

      Using this section, the data can be grouped by the messages' :guilabel:`Status`, or who it was
      :guilabel:`Sent By`.

      There is also the option to group the data by :guilabel:`Sent Period`, which has its own
      sub-menu of options to choose from. The :guilabel:`Sent Period` options are :guilabel:`Year`,
      :guilabel:`Quarter`, :guilabel:`Month`, :guilabel:`Week`, and :guilabel:`Day`.

      If none of the above :guilabel:`Group By` options deliver the desired results, click
      :guilabel:`Add Custom Group` at the bottom of the :guilabel:`Group By` section. Doing so
      reveals a drop-down menu, wherein custom criteria can be selected and applied, thus delivering
      any grouping of data that may be desired.

   .. tab:: Favorites

      This section provides the opportunity to save custom filters and/or groupings for future use.
      To utilize this section, click the :guilabel:`Save current search` field, which reveals
      additional fields.

      .. image:: email_marketing/favorites-dropdown.png
         :align: center

      Give the favorited filter/grouping a title on the blank line above the checkboxes for
      :guilabel:`Default filter` and :guilabel:`Shared`.

      Ticking the box for :guilabel:`Default filter` makes this favorited filter/grouping the
      default option. Ticking the box for :guilabel:`Shared` allows other users to see and use this
      favorited filter/grouping.

      When all desired options are configured, click :guilabel:`Save` to save the filter/grouping in
      the :guilabel:`Favorites` section of the mega drop-down menu.

Settings
========

To view and modify the *Email Marketing* settings, navigate to :menuselection:`Email Marketing app
--> Configuration --> Settings`.

.. image:: email_marketing/configuration-settings.png
   :align: center
   :alt: View of the Configuration menu with Settings page in the Odoo Email Marketing application.

On the :guilabel:`Settings` page, there are four features available.

.. image:: email_marketing/settings.png
   :align: center
   :alt: View of the Settings page in the Odoo Email Marketing application.

The features are:

- :guilabel:`Mailing Campaigns`: enables the option to manage mass mailing campaigns.
- :guilabel:`Blacklist Option when Unsubscribing`: allows recipients to blacklist themselves from
  future mailings during the unsubscribing process.
- :guilabel:`Dedicated Server`: provides the option to utilize a separate, dedicated server for
  mailings. When enabled, Odoo reveals a new field (and link), in which the specific server
  configurations must be entered, in order for it to connect properly to Odoo.
- :guilabel:`24H Stat Mailing Reports`: allows users to check how well mailings have performed a day
  after it has been sent.

.. _email_marketing/create_email:

Create an email
===============

To create an email, open the :menuselection:`Email Marketing` application, and click the
:guilabel:`New` button in the upper-left corner of the :guilabel:`Mailings` dashboard page.

Clicking :guilabel:`New` reveals a blank email form.

.. image:: email_marketing/blank-email-detail-form.png
   :align: center
   :alt: View of a blank email detail form in Odoo Email Marketing application.

On the email form, there are fields for the :ref:`Subject <email_marketing/subject>` and
:ref:`Recipients <email_marketing/recipients>` of the email.

Beneath that, there are three tabs: :ref:`Mail Body <email_marketing/mail_body>`, :ref:`A/B Tests
<email_marketing/ab_tests>`, and :ref:`Settings <email_marketing/settings_tab>`.

.. _email_marketing/subject:

Subject
-------

First, enter a :guilabel:`Subject` to the email. The :guilabel:`Subject` is visible in the
recipients' inbox, allowing them to quickly see what the message is about.

.. note::
   The :guilabel:`Subject` field is mandatory. An email can **not** be sent without a
   :guilabel:`Subject`.

The :guilabel:`(smiley face with a plus sign)` icon at the end of the :guilabel:`Subject` field
represents emojis that can be added to the :guilabel:`Subject` field. Clicking that icon reveals a
pop-up menu of emojis that can be used.

Beside the :guilabel:`(smiley face with a plus sign)` icon at the end of the :guilabel:`Subject`
field is an empty :guilabel:`(star)` icon. When clicked, the :guilabel:`(star)` icon turns gold, and
the email is saved as a template in the :guilabel:`Mail Body` tab, which can be used again in the
future.

.. _email_marketing/recipients:

Recipients
----------

Beneath the :guilabel:`Subject` field on the email form is the :guilabel:`Recipients` field. In this
field, select the recipients of the email. By default, the :guilabel:`Mailing List` option is
selected, but clicking the field reveals a drop-down menu of other recipient options.

With the default :guilabel:`Mailing List` option selected, a specific mailing list **must** be
chosen from the adjacent :guilabel:`Select mailing lists` field drop-down menu.

.. tip::
   More than one mailing list can be chosen from the :guilabel:`Select mailing lists` field.

Odoo then sends the email to contacts on that specific mailing list(s).

.. seealso::
   :doc:`email_marketing/mailing_lists`

When the :guilabel:`Recipients` field is clicked, a drop-down menu of other options is revealed.
Each option provides different ways Odoo can create a target audience for the email.

.. image:: email_marketing/recipients-dropdown.png
   :align: center
   :alt: View of recipients drop-down menu in the Odoo Email Marketing application.

Those options (excluding the default :guilabel:`Mailing List`) provide the option to create a more
specified recipient filter, in an equation-like format, which appears beneath the
:guilabel:`Recipients` field.

The :guilabel:`Recipients` field options, other than the default :guilabel:`Mailing List` option,
are as follows:

- :guilabel:`Contact`: ties specifically to the *Contacts* app, and includes all the contacts
  entered in the database.
- :guilabel:`Event Registration`: ties specifically to the *Events* app, and provides opportunities
  to interact with event registrants, in order to communicate important information about the
  event(s), or nurture other valuable actions, such as post-event surveys, purchases, etc.
- :guilabel:`Lead/Opportunity`: ties specifically to records in the *CRM* application, which opens
  up a number of opportunities to influence sales or purchase decisions.
- :guilabel:`Mailing Contact`: ties specifically to the *Email Marketing* app, and focuses on
  specific mailing contacts that have been entered in that specific application, and are related to
  a specific mailing list. These contacts are also unique because they do *not* have their own
  contact card in the *Contacts* application. This list can be accessed by navigating to
  :menuselection:`Email Marketing app --> Mailing Lists --> Mailing List Contacts`.
- :guilabel:`Sales Order`: ties specifically to the *Sales* app, and focuses on a specific sales
  orders in the database.

Add recipient filter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add a more specific recipient filter to any :guilabel:`Recipient` option, select any recipient
option (other than :guilabel:`Mailing List`), and click the :guilabel:`Modify filter (right-facing
arrow)` icon beneath the :guilabel:`Recipient` field to reveal three subsequent filter rule fields,
formatted like an equation.

It is highly recommended that users implement detailed targeting criteria for the
:guilabel:`Recipients` field. Typically, a single line of targeting logic is not sufficient enough
for an email campaign.

While the :guilabel:`Mailing List` option is adequate for the :guilabel:`Recipients` field, the
:guilabel:`Lead/Opportunity` and :guilabel:`Event Registration` options provide far more detailed
targeting criteria, which can be added on top of those seed sources.

.. example::
   For example, with the :guilabel:`Lead/Opportunity` option chosen in the :guilabel:`Recipients`
   field, users can add various custom criteria related to :guilabel:`Created on` dates,
   :guilabel:`Stages`, :guilabel:`Tags`, :guilabel:`Lost Reasons`, :guilabel:`Sales Teams`,
   :guilabel:`Active` statuses, :guilabel:`Country`, and so much more.

   .. image:: email_marketing/detailed-filter-records.png
      :align: center
      :alt: View of how recipient filters can be customized in Odoo Email Marketing.

To reveal the sub-menu options within the filter rule fields, click each field, and make the desired
selections, until the preferred configuration has been achieved.

The number of :guilabel:`records` in the database that match the configured rule(s) are indicated
beneath the configured filter rule(s), in green.

.. image:: email_marketing/filter-records.png
   :align: center
   :alt: View of how recipient filters can be customized in Odoo Email Marketing.

.. note::
   Some sub-menu options in the first rule field allow for a second choice to provide even more
   specificity.

To the right of each rule, there are three additional options, represented by :guilabel:`➕ (plus
sign)`, :guilabel:`(sitemap)`, and :guilabel:`🗑️ (trash)` icons.

- The :guilabel:`➕ (plus sign)` icon adds a new node (line) to the overall targeting logic.
- The :guilabel:`(sitemap)` icon adds a branch to the node. A branch contains two additional,
  indented sub-nodes that are related to that specific rule, providing even more specificity to the
  parent line above it.
- The :guilabel:`🗑️ (trash)` icon deletes a specific node (line) in the array of logic.

.. _email_marketing/mail_body:

Mail Body tab
-------------

In the :guilabel:`Mail Body` tab, there are a number of pre-configured message templates to choose
from.

.. image:: email_marketing/mail-body-templates.png
   :align: center
   :alt: View of the templates in the Mail Body tab in Odoo Email Marketing application.

Select the desired template, and proceed to modify every element of its design details with Odoo's
drag-and-drop building blocks, which appear on the right sidebar when a template is chosen.

.. image:: email_marketing/template-building-blocks.png
   :align: center
   :alt: View of the building blocks in the Mail Body tab in Odoo Email Marketing application.

The features on the sidebar used to create and customize emails are separated into three sections:
:guilabel:`Blocks`, :guilabel:`Customize`, and :guilabel:`Design`.

Each building block provides unique features and professional design elements. To use a building
block, drag-and-drop the desired block element onto the body of the email being built. Once dropped,
various aspects of the building block can be customized.

.. tip::
   To build an email from the ground up, without any building block elements, select the
   :guilabel:`Plain Text` template. When selected, Odoo provides a completely blank email canvas,
   which can be customized in a number of way using the front-end rich text editor that accepts
   forward slash `/` commands.

   When `/` is typed into the blank body of the email, while using a :guilabel:`Plain Text`
   template, a drop-down menu of various design elements appears, which can be used to create the
   desired email design.

.. _email_marketing/ab_tests:

A/B Tests tab
-------------

Initially, when the :guilabel:`A/B Tests` tab is opened on an email form, the only option available
is :guilabel:`Allow A/B Testing`. This is **not** a required option.

If this option is enabled, recipients are only mailed *once* for the entirety of the campaign.

This allows the user to send different versions of the same mailing to randomly selected recipients
to gauge the effectiveness of various designs, formats, layouts, content, and so on -- without any
duplicate messages being sent.

When the checkbox beside :guilabel:`Allow A/B Testing` is ticked, an :guilabel:`on (%)` field
appears, in which the user determines the percentage of the pre-configured recipients that are going
to be sent this current version of the mailing as part of the test.

.. note::
   The default figure in the :guilabel:`on (%)` field is `10`, but that figure can be changed at any
   time.

Beneath that, two additional fields appear:

The :guilabel:`Winner Selection` field provides a drop-down menu of options, wherein the user
decides what criteria should be used to determine the "winning" version of the email tests that are
sent.

The options in the :guilabel:`Winner Selection` field are as follows:

- :guilabel:`Manual`: allows the user to determine the "winning" version of the mailing. This option
  removes the :guilabel:`Send Final On` field.
- :guilabel:`Highest Open Rate` (default): the mailing with the highest open rate is determined to
  be the "winning" version.
- :guilabel:`Highest Click Rate`: the mailing with the highest click rate is determined to be the
  "winning" version.
- :guilabel:`Highest Reply Rate`: the mailing with the highest reply rate is determined to be the
  "winning" version.
- :guilabel:`Leads`: the mailing with the most leads generated is determined to be the "winning"
  version.
- :guilabel:`Quotations`: the mailing with the most quotations generated is determined to be the
  "winning" version.
- :guilabel:`Revenues`: the mailing with the most revenue generated is determined to be the
  "winning" version.

The :guilabel:`Send Final On` field allows users to choose a date that is used to know *when* Odoo
should determine the "winning" email, and subsequently, send that version of the email to the
remaining recipients.

.. image:: email_marketing/ab-test-tab.png
   :align: center
   :alt: View of the A/B Tests tab in Odoo Email Marketing application.

To the right of those fields is a :guilabel:`Create an Alternative Version` button. When clicked,
Odoo presents a new :guilabel:`Mail Body` tab for the user to create an alternate version of the
email to test.

.. _email_marketing/settings_tab:

Settings tab
------------

The options present in the :guilabel:`Settings` tab of the mail form are divided into two sections:
:guilabel:`Email Content` and :guilabel:`Tracking`.

.. note::
   The options available in the :guilabel:`Settings` tab vary depending on if the *Mailing
   Campaigns* feature is activated in :menuselection:`Email Marketing --> Configuration -->
   Settings`. See :ref:`email_marketing/mailing-campaigns` for more information.

Without the *Mailing Campaigns* feature activated, the :guilabel:`Settings` tab on the email form
only contains the :guilabel:`Preview Text`, :guilabel:`Send From`, :guilabel:`Reply To`,
:guilabel:`Attachments`, and :guilabel:`Responsible` fields.

.. image:: email_marketing/settings-without-features.png
   :align: center
   :alt: View of settings tab in Odoo Email Marketing app, without campaign setting activated.

Email content
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- :guilabel:`Preview Text`: allows the user to enter a preview sentence to encourage recipients to
  open the email. In most inboxes, this is displayed next to the subject. If left empty, the first
  characters of the email content appear, instead. The ability to add an emoji in this field is
  available, as well, via the :guilabel:`(smiley face with a plus sign)` icon.
- :guilabel:`Send From`: designate an email alias that displays as the sender of this particular
  email.
- :guilabel:`Reply To`: designate an email alias to whom all the replies of this particular email
  are sent.
- :guilabel:`Attach a file`: if any specific files are required (or helpful) for this email, click
  the :guilabel:`Attachments` button, and upload the desired file(s) to the email.

Tracking
~~~~~~~~

- :guilabel:`Responsible`: designate a user in the database to be responsible for this particular
  email.

.. note::
   If the *Mailing Campaign* feature *is* activated, an additional :guilabel:`Campaign` field
   appears in the :guilabel:`Tracking` section of the :guilabel:`Settings` tab.

   .. image:: email_marketing/settings-tab-with-campaign.png
      :align: center
      :alt: View of settings tab in Odoo Email Marketing when campaign setting is activated.

   The additional :guilabel:`Campaign` field allows users to attach this particular email to a
   mailing campaign, if desired.

   If the desired campaign is not available in the initial drop-down menu, select :guilabel:`Search
   More` to reveal a complete list of all mailing campaigns in the database.

   Or, type the name of the desired mailing campaign in the :guilabel:`Campaign` field, until Odoo
   reveals the desired campaign in the drop-down menu. Then, select the desired campaign.

Send, schedule, test
====================

Once the mailing is finalized, the following options can be utilized, via buttons located in the
upper-left corner of the email form: :ref:`Send <email_marketing/send>`, :ref:`Schedule
<email_marketing/schedule>`, and :ref:`Test <email_marketing/test>`.

.. _email_marketing/send:

   :align: center
   :alt: View of pop-up window that appears when the test button on an email form is clicked.

From this pop-up window, enter the email addresses of the contacts to whom Odoo should send this
test email in the :guilabel:`Recipients` field. Multiple contacts can be added in this field, if
desired.

Once all the desired email addresses have been entered in the :guilabel:`Recipients` field, click
the :guilabel:`Send Test` button.

.. warning::
   By default, there's a daily limit applied for **all emails** sent throughout **all
   applications**. So, if there are remaining emails to be sent after a limit has been reached,
   those mailings are **not** sent automatically the next day. The sending needs to be forced, by
   opening the email and clicking :guilabel:`Retry`.

.. _email_marketing/mailing-campaigns:

Mailing campaigns
=================

The *Email Marketing* application provides users with the ability to build mailing campaigns.

In order to create and customize mailing campaigns, the *Mailing Campaigns* feature **must** be

Lost leads reactivation email
=============================

In Odoo, lost leads are removed from the active *CRM* pipeline, but can still be targeted with the
*Email Marketing* application for strategic campaign purposes, such as lost leads reactivation.

A lost leads reactivation email looks at the leads that were lost during a specific period of time,
and uses custom filters and lost reasons to exclude undesirable leads from the mailing list.

Once a lost leads reactivation email is complete, it can be sent as is, modified and sent to
different groups for A/B testing, or saved as a template for later.

.. example::
   A warehouse has leftover merchandise from a limited run of items from last year. To help clear
   out the excess inventory, the warehouse manager creates a lost leads email to reach out to old
   opportunities that were lost, and inform them that the limited merchandise is back in stock.

   The warehouse manager uses the following filters for a lost leads email:

   - :guilabel:`Blacklist` *is* `not set`
   - :guilabel:`Created on` *>=* `01/01/2024 00:00:01`
   - :guilabel:`Stage` *is not in* `New`, `Qualified`, or `Won`
   - :guilabel:`Lost Reason` *is in* `Not enough stock`
   - and either :guilabel:`Active` *is* `set` or `not set`

   .. image:: lost_leads_email/example.png
      :align: center
      :alt: A lost leads reactivation filter list excluding lost reasons like Too Expensive.

.. tip::
   As filters are added and removed, pay attention to the :guilabel:`# record(s)` value below the
   filtering section. This value indicates the total number of records that match the current
   criteria.

   To view a list of all matching records, click the :guilabel:`# record(s)` text.

   .. image:: lost_leads_email/records.png
      :align: center
      :alt: The # record(s) text is located below the list of Recipient filters.

Minimum requirements
====================

In order to create and deliver a lost leads reactivation email campaign, the *CRM* and *Email
Marketing* applications **must** be :ref:`installed <general/install>` and configured.

Here are the minimum necessary filters that pertain to a lost leads reactivation mailing campaign:

- The :ref:`Recipients <email_marketing/recipients_field>` field **must** be set to the
  *Lead/Opportunity* model.
- A :ref:`Blacklist <email_marketing/blacklist_filter>` filter to exclude unsubscribed recipients.
- A :ref:`Created on <email_marketing/created_on_filter>` to target leads that were lost during a
  specific period of time.
- :ref:`Stage <email_marketing/stage_filter>` filter(s) to exclude leads that were already won, or
  are still active in new stages of the sales pipeline (i.e. *New*, *Qualified*, etc.). These values
  will be different per organization; however, it's minimally viable to exclude all the leads in the
  *Won* stage.
- One or more :ref:`Lost Reason <email_marketing/lost_reason_filter>` filters to exclude undesired
  leads, such as duplicate, spam, or irrelevant records.
- A pair of :ref:`Active <email_marketing/active_filter>` filters to target *both* active and
  inactive leads.

Add the necessary filters
=========================

First, navigate to the :menuselection:`Email Marketing` app, and on the :guilabel:`Mailings` page,
click the :guilabel:`New` button in the top-left corner.

.. _email_marketing/recipients_field:

On the new :guilabel:`Mailings` form, enter an appropriate :guilabel:`Subject` line for the email in
the corresponding field. Then, in the :guilabel:`Recipients` field, choose the
:guilabel:`Lead/Opportunity` model from the drop-down menu.

.. _email_marketing/blacklist_filter:

In the rules section, located beneath the :guilabel:`Recipients` field, click the modify filter
(:guilabel:`▶ (triangle pointing right)`) icon to expand the filter rules. Leave the default
:guilabel:`Blacklist` rule in place.

.. _email_marketing/created_on_filter:

Created on
----------

Begin by clicking :guilabel:`New Rule` beneath the default :guilabel:`Blacklist` rule. Then, click
the first field of the new rule that appears, and select the :guilabel:`Created on` parameter from
the drop-down menu. With that in place, a specific time period during which the targeted leads were
lost can be designated (e.g. 30 days prior, 90 days prior, previous year, etc.).

Then, in the second field, select :guilabel:`<= (less than or equal to)`, :guilabel:`>= (greater
than or equal to)`, or :guilabel:`is between` as a date operator, in order to frame the time
selection chosen in the third field.

In the third field, use the calendar popover window to select dates, and click :guilabel:`Apply` to
lock in the time range.

.. image:: lost_leads_email/created-on.png
   :align: center
   :alt: A custom filter rule setting the time period to be anything before today's date.

.. important::
   When there is more than one rule applied, make sure the statement at the top of the
   :guilabel:`Recipients` filter list reads: :guilabel:`Match all of the following rules`. If it
   does not, click on the statement, and select :guilabel:`all` from the drop-down menu (as opposed
   to :guilabel:`any`).

   .. image:: lost_leads_email/match-all.png
      :align: center
      :alt: The statement at the top of the filters list, with the drop-down menu open.

.. _email_marketing/stage_filter:

Stage
-----

Now, add the :guilabel:`Stage` filter to exclude leads that are in the *New*, *Qualified*, and *Won*
stages of the sales pipeline.

.. note::
   This step assumes that the *New*, *Qualified*, and *Won* stages exist in the CRM pipeline;
   however, stage names may differ from business to business. Refer to the database's actual stage
   names in the *CRM* app's pipeline to complete this step, accordingly.

Begin again by clicking :guilabel:`New Rule` and select :guilabel:`Stage` from the first field's
drop-down menu. In the second field, select the :guilabel:`is not in` operator, and in the third
field, select the :guilabel:`New`, :guilabel:`Qualified` and :guilabel:`Won` stages to define the
rule's parameters.

When the rule is added in this way, the logic in the third field renders as :code:`OR` (`|`)
statements.

.. image:: lost_leads_email/stage-is-in.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Include multiple Stages in the filtering rule, using the "is in" operator.

.. tip::
   Another way to add *Stage* rules, is to do so on a one-rule-per-row basis using the
   :guilabel:`contains` or :guilabel:`does not contain` operators, and manually typing out the
   defining characters in each stage name. This method, however, only allows for one selection at a
   time, which can be useful for quickly turning on/off filters in the :guilabel:`Search...` bar.

   .. image:: lost_leads_email/stages.png
      :align: center
      :alt: Three filter rules requiring that the Stage does not contain New, Qualified, or Won.

.. _email_marketing/lost_reason_filter:

Lost Reason
-----------

Next, add one or more :guilabel:`Lost Reason` rules to exclude leads that should **not** be targeted
for specific :doc:`lost reasons <../../sales/crm/pipeline/lost_opportunities>`.

To do that, create another :guilabel:`New Rule`, once again. Then, in the rule's first field, select
:guilabel:`Lost Reason` from the drop-down menu. For the operator, choose either :guilabel:`is not
in` or :guilabel:`does not contain` from the drop-down menu. With either selection, use the third
field to enter a lost reason (or multiple lost reasons, depending on your operator choice) to
include in the rule.

If choosing the :guilabel:`does not contain` operator, then repeat the preceding steps to add more
lost reasons, as needed, where each lost reason occupies one rule row at a time.

For more information, refer to the section below outlining how to :ref:`select appropriate lost
reasons <email_marketing/select_lost_reasons>`.

.. image:: lost_leads_email/reasons.png
   :align: center
   :alt: A list of filter rules that exclude all lost reasons other than the desired reason.

.. _email_marketing/active_filter:

Active
------

Finally, add a pair of :guilabel:`Active` filters to include both active and inactive leads for the
campaign.

.. important::
   Adding both active *and* inactive lead records is necessary to capture the full scope of lost
   leads in the database. Doing one without the other greatly impacts the number of targetable
   records for the email campaign, and does **not** include a complete or accurate lost leads
   audience.

First, click the :guilabel:`(Add Branch)` icon on the most recently created rule (e.g.
:guilabel:`Lost Reason`), which is the middle of three icons located to the right of the rule row.
Doing so adds a pair of :guilabel:`any of` rules. Then, in the top rule's first field of the
newly-created branch, select the :guilabel:`Active` parameter from the drop-down menu. The rule then
automatically fills out to read: :guilabel:`Active` *is* `set`.

For the first field of the bottom rule of the branch, select :guilabel:`Active` from the drop-down
menu again. However, this time, select :guilabel:`is not` from the operator drop-down menu in the
second field. The rule should then read: :guilabel:`Active` *is not* `set`.

.. image:: lost_leads_email/active.png
   :align: center
   :alt: A pair of Match Any Of filter rules that include both active and inactive leads.

Add body content
================

Now, with the domain section of the email campaign complete, create the body content of the email
using any of the premade stylized templates, or choose between the :guilabel:`Plain Text` or
:guilabel:`Start From Scratch` options for more granular control. For more information, refer to the
*Email Marketing* :ref:`documentation on how to create an email <email_marketing/create_email>`.

.. tip::
   To save the set of filters for later use, click :guilabel:`Save as Favorite Filter 💾 (floppy
   disk)`, enter a name (such as `Lost Leads`), and click :guilabel:`Add`.

   .. image:: lost_leads_email/favorite-filter.png
      :align: center
      :alt: The Save as Favorite Filter pop-up can save the lost leads criteria for later.

Send or schedule
================

Once all the components of the email campaign are complete, either:

- click the purple :guilabel:`Send` button at the top-left of the form to immediately send the
  email; or
- click the gray :guilabel:`Schedule` button, located to the right of the :guilabel:`Send` button,
  to send the email at a future date and time.

.. tip::
   Consider using *A/B Testing* to send an alternate version of the email to a percentage of the
   target leads. This can help determine what subject lines and body content produce the best
   click-through rates, before sending a final version to the remaining leads.

   To do so, open the :guilabel:`A/B Tests` tab on the mailing form and check the box next to
   :guilabel:`Allow A/B Testing`. Then, adjust the parameters as needed, and click :guilabel:`Create
   an Alternative Version`.

   .. image:: lost_leads_email/ab-testing.png
      :align: center
      :alt: The A/B Tests tab with the Allow A/B Testing box checked to create an alternate version.

.. _email_marketing/select_lost_reasons:

Select appropriate lost reasons
===============================

When a lead is marked as lost, Odoo recommends selecting a *Lost Reason* to indicate why the
opportunity did not result in a sale. Doing so keeps the pipeline organized and reporting data
accurate, and generates potential to follow up with the lead in the future.

If an existing *Lost Reason* is not applicable, users with the necessary permissions can create new
ones, which means the lost reasons in a database can vary from organization to organization, and
from pipeline to pipeline.

For more information on *Lost Reasons*, including the creation of them, refer to
:doc:`../../sales/crm/pipeline/lost_opportunities`.

By default, Odoo includes a few common *Lost Reasons*, such as:

- *Too expensive*
- *We don't have people/skills*
- *Not enough stock*

When determining which reasons to include in a lost leads reactivation email, consider what the
email is advertising, in order pinpoint one or more relevant lost reasons. Then, add a rule stating,
:guilabel:`Lost Reason` *does not contain* `_____` for every reason in the database, **except** for
the relevant one(s).

.. example::
   If the email advertises a selection of previously-limited merchandise that is now back in stock,
   it makes sense to target leads with the lost reason: *not enough stock*.

   .. image:: lost_leads_email/out-of-stock.png
      :align: center
      :alt: A list of filter rules that exclude all lost reasons except for Out of Stock.

   If the email advertises a price reduction, it makes sense to target leads with the lost reason:
   *too expensive*.

Analyze the results
===================

After sending a lost leads reactivation email, marketing teams can use the smart buttons along the
top of the email to analyze the results, and determine follow-up actions.

Clicking on any of the smart buttons opens a list of records matching that button's specific
criteria.

.. image:: lost_leads_email/smart-buttons.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The Mailing page of a sent email showing the smart buttons along the top of the page.

The smart buttons include:

- :guilabel:`Sent`: total number of emails sent.
- :guilabel:`Opened`: percentage of recipients that opened the email.
- :guilabel:`Replied`: percentage of recipients that replied to the email.
- :guilabel:`Clicked`: click-through rate (%) of recipients that clicked on a link in the email.
- :guilabel:`Leads/Opportunities`: number of leads (or opportunities) that have been created in the
  *CRM* pipeline, as a result of the email campaign.
- :guilabel:`Quotations`: number of quotations that have been created in the *Sales* application, as
  a result of the email.
- :guilabel:`Invoiced`: total revenues generated, as a result of the email campaign, via invoices
  sent to, and paid by, customers. These values are recorded in either the *Invoicing* or
  *Accounting* application, depending on which app is installed in the database.
- :guilabel:`Received`: percentage of recipients that received the email.
- :guilabel:`Bounced`: percentage of emails that bounced (:dfn:`not delivered`).
- :guilabel:`Ignored`: the number of recipients that received the email, but have not interacted
  with it in a meaningful way (i.e. opened, clicked, etc.).

Email nurturing
===============

*Email nurturing* (sometimes referred to as *lead nurturing*) is the process of sending a series of
timely and relevant "nudge" emails to connect with a lead, build a deeper relationship, and
ultimately convert the lead into a sale.

The point of nurturing is to keep the email campaign "visible" or at the top of a lead's inbox,
until they are ready to buy.

There are many approaches to effective lead nurturing, but they often involve:

- Sending an initial email (such as, a lost leads reactivation email).
- Sending a follow-up email each week (or according to specific triggers) for the duration of the
  campaign.
- Continuously analyzing results to learn what approaches have resulted in sales.
- Continuously adjusting the approach to remain "visible" at the top of the lead's inbox, and
  hopefully, get a meaningful response from the lead.

As a campaign progresses, a marketing team may send different follow-up emails depending on how a
lead responded the previous week.

.. example::
   A marketing team wants to advertise a restocking of limited-run merchandise to all leads with a
   lost reason of *not enough stock*. They develop the following three-week long lead nurturing
   campaign.

   - **Week 1:** the marketing team sends an initial email, with the subject line: *“Limited run
     merchandise is back in stock! Act now!”*
   - **Week 2:** the marketing team sends two different emails, depending on how a lead responded.

     - If a lead ignored the Week 1 email: *“Stock is almost out, did you get yours?”*
     - If a lead clicked on the Week 1 email: *"You still have time to add this to your collection"*

   - **Week 3:** the marketing team sends a final email to all leads who have not been converted
     stating: *“20% off, don't miss your last chance to get these items before they're gone!”*

   Throughout the campaign, the marketing team continuously refers to the smart buttons along the
   top of the mailing page to see what percentages of leads are opening, clicking on, or ignoring
   the emails. They also regularly analyze reports on how many opportunities, quotations, and
   invoices have been generated by the campaign.

Mailing lists
=============

Mailing lists in Odoo are used for both pre and post sales communications in the *Email Marketing*
application. They provide sales teams with qualified lead lists, focus group participants, or
current customers that fulfill specific criteria.

Mailing lists can be generated in Odoo, and exported as a downloadable file, or into the
*Knowledge*, *Dashboards*, or *Spreadsheets* applications, or imported via copy/paste or file
upload.

Create mailing lists
====================

To create a mailing list in the *Email Marketing* application, navigate to :menuselection:`Email
Marketing app --> Mailing Lists --> Mailing Lists --> New`.

Clicking :guilabel:`New` reveals a blank mailing list form.

.. image:: mailing_lists/new-mailing-list-form.png
   :align: center
   :alt: View of the mailing list form in the Odoo Email Marketing application.

On the form, type a name in the :guilabel:`Mailing List` field at the top.

If the mailing list should be accessible by recipients from the subscription management page,
allowing them to update their preferences, tick the box next to :guilabel:`Show In Preferences`.

In the upper-left corner of the mailing list form, there are two buttons: :guilabel:`Send Mailing`
and :guilabel:`Send SMS`.

.. important::
   The :guilabel:`Send SMS` button **only** appears if the *SMS Marketing* application is installed.

Clicking :guilabel:`Send Mailing` reveals a separate page with a blank email template form, which
can be filled out by following steps explained in the :doc:`Email Marketing doc
<../email_marketing>`.

Clicking :guilabel:`Send SMS` reveals a separate page with a blank SMS template form, which can be
filled out by following steps explained in the :doc:`SMS Marketing doc
<../sms_marketing>`.

At the top of the mailing list form is a series of smart buttons that display a variety of metrics
related to the specific mailing list. When any of the smart buttons are clicked, a separate page is
revealed, showcasing detailed analytics related to that particular statistic.

The smart buttons available on a mailing list form are:

- :guilabel:`Recipients`: how many people are subscribed to the mailing list
- :guilabel:`Mailings`: how many mailings have been sent using this mailing list
- :guilabel:`% Bounce`: percentage of mailings related to this mailing list that have been bounced
  back
- :guilabel:`% Opt-out`: percentage of recipients that have opted-out of mailings from this mailing
  list
- :guilabel:`% Blacklist`: percentage of recipients that have blacklisted themselves from the
  mailing list altogether

Once all the configurations on the mailing list form are complete, Odoo automatically adds the new
mailing list to the :guilabel:`Mailing List` page in the *Email Marketing* app
(:menuselection:`Email Marketing app --> Mailing Lists --> Mailing Lists`).

.. _marketing/mailing-list/contacts:

Add contacts to mailing list
============================

In Odoo *Email Marketing*, there are a few different ways to add contacts to a mailing list.

From the :guilabel:`Mailing Lists` page (:menuselection:`Email Marketing --> Mailing Lists -->
Mailing Lists`), click the :guilabel:`Total Contacts` link on the line of the desired mailing list
to which contacts should be added.

Doing so reveals a separate :guilabel:`Mailing List Contacts` page for that specific mailing list,
where contacts can be created or imported, and then added to the specific mailing list.

This same page can also be accessed by clicking the desired mailing list from the :guilabel:`Mailing
Lists` page, and then clicking the :guilabel:`Recipients` smart button on the mailing list form.

Doing so *also* reveals a separate :guilabel:`Mailing List Contacts` page for that specific mailing
list, where contacts can be created or imported, and then added to the specific mailing list.

Contacts can also be directly imported to a specific mailing list from the :guilabel:`Mailing Lists`
page, by clicking :guilabel:`Import Contacts` to the far-right of the desired mailing list.

.. image:: mailing_lists/import-contacts-button.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The import contacts button of a mailing list line in Odoo Email Marketing.

Doing so reveals an :guilabel:`Import Mailing Contacts` pop-up form.

.. image:: mailing_lists/import-mailing-contacts-popup.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The import mailing contacts pop-up form that appears in Odoo Email Marketing.

Here, the desired mailing list is auto-populated in the :guilabel:`Import contacts in` field.
Beneath that, write or paste email addresses in the :guilabel:`Contact List` field.

The option to import a country, company name, and more is available, via the :guilabel:`Upload a
file` link at the bottom of the pop-up form.

When all contacts and configurations are complete, click :guilabel:`Import`.

To add contacts to a specific mailing list from a master list of all mailing list contacts in the
database, navigate to :menuselection:`Email Marketing app --> Mailing Lists --> Mailing List
Contacts`. Doing so reveals the :guilabel:`Mailing List Contacts` page, featuring a list of all
contacts associated with every mailing list.

.. image:: mailing_lists/mailing-list-page.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The Mailing List page in the Odoo Email Marketing application.

The default :guilabel:`Exclude Blacklisted Emails` filter appears in the search bar.

From the :guilabel:`Mailing List Contacts` page, contacts can be created and/or imported, and then
added to a mailing list.

To add an existing contact to a mailing list, select the desired contact from the list on the
:guilabel:`Mailing List Contacts` page to reveal their contact form.

At the bottom of their contact form, click :guilabel:`Add a line` under the :guilabel:`Mailing List`
column, locate the desired mailing list from the drop-down menu, and select it.

.. image:: mailing_lists/contact-form-mailing-list-add.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The Add a line for mailing lists on a standard contact form in Odoo Email Marketing.

.. tip::
   A mailing list can be created directly from a contact form, by typing the name of the new mailing
   list in the :guilabel:`Mailing List` field. Then, after a new mailing list name has been entered,
   two options appear on the drop-down menu beneath the new mailing list name.

   From this drop-down menu, select :guilabel:`Create` to create the mailing list and edit it later,
   or select :guilabel:`Create and edit...` to create and edit the new mailing list right away.

To remove a contact from a mailing list that the contact has been added to, enable the
:guilabel:`Opt Out` checkbox. If the :guilabel:`Opt Out` checkbox is ticked, the ability to add a
:guilabel:`Reason` why the contact opted-out is also available.

When/if a contact *has* opted-out of a mailing list, the date they activated their opt-out appears
in the :guilabel:`Unsubscription Date` column on their contact form.

Lastly, the initial :guilabel:`Subscription Date` can be seen, as well. This field is auto-populated
with the date and time their subscription to the mailing list has been saved.

Multiple mailing lists can be added to a single contact form.

To delete any mailing list from a contact form, simply click the :guilabel:`🗑️ (trash can)` icon.

Link mailing list to website
============================

When a mailing list is created in the database, Odoo provides the option to directly link the
mailing list to the Odoo-built website (created via the Odoo *Website* application).

To link a mailing list to a website, navigate to the front-end of the website, which can be
accomplished in a variety of ways throughout the database. The most direct way to get to the
front-end of the website is to simply open the :menuselection:`Website` application from the main
Odoo dashboard.

Doing so reveals the designated homepage of the Odoo-built website for the database.

From the front-end of the website, click the :guilabel:`Edit` button in the upper-right corner. When
clicked, Odoo reveals a right-sidebar, filled with drag-and-drop *building blocks*, packed with
various features, options, and design elements.

Next, in the search bar of the right-sidebar, search for `Newsletter`. The :guilabel:`Newsletter`
selection of building blocks is used to add subscription fields for any mailing list onto the
website.

.. image:: mailing_lists/newsletter-block-search.png
   :align: center
   :alt: View of how to quickly search for Newsletter blocks in the Odoo Website application.

Doing so reveals the following building block options: :guilabel:`Newsletter Block`,
:guilabel:`Newsletter Popup`, and :guilabel:`Newsletter`. Any of these options can be used to add
subscription fields for a mailing list onto the website.

The :guilabel:`Newsletter Block` option places a customizable block onto the body of the website
where a visitor to enter their email and click a button to subscribe to a designated mailing list.

.. image:: mailing_lists/newsletter-block-sample.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Sample of how a newsletter block appears on an Odoo Website.

The :guilabel:`Newsletter Popup` option reveals a customizable pop-up window that appears when a
visitor scrolls to the specific section of the webpage on which the building block is placed. When
the visitor reaches the designated section, a pop-up window appears, in which a visitor can enter
their email address, click a button, and subscribe to that predetermined mailing list.

.. image:: mailing_lists/newsletter-popup-sample.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Sample of how a newsletter popup block appears on an Odoo Website.

The :guilabel:`Newsletter` option provides the same functionality as the other options. However, it
only consists of a field for the visitor to enter their email address, and a button to subscribe to
the mailing list.

It is covertly designed in this fashion to be cleanly implemented into the content of the webpage
and/or footer.

.. image:: mailing_lists/newsletter-sample.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Sample of how a newsletter block appears on an Odoo Website.

Once the desired newsletter building block is chosen, drag-and-drop it onto the body of the
website. Then, select the newly-placed newsletter building block to reveal its configuration options
on the right-sidebar.

From there, open the :guilabel:`Newsletter` drop-down menu, and select the specific mailing list
that should be applied to the block.

.. image:: mailing_lists/newsletter-dropdown-customize-sidebar.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The newsletter drop-down menu in the customize sidebar that appears in Odoo Website.

Once the desired configurations and customizations are complete, be sure to click the
:guilabel:`Save` button in the upper-right corner.

Now, when a visitor enters their email address, and clicks the button to subscribe, they are
instantly subscribed to that pre-configured mailing list. They are also added as a contact for that
mailing list in Odoo *Email Marketing*.

==================================================
SECTION: unsubscriptions.rst

==================================================

==================================
Manage unsubscriptions (blacklist)
==================================

Providing recipients with the power to unsubscribe from mailing lists is not only a smart business
practice, it's often a legal requirement. Allowing recipients to unsubscribe from a mailing list
establishes a sense of trust and control with an audience. It also helps companies appear more
genuine, and less *spammy*.

Unsubscribe and blacklist
=========================

In addition to having the option to unsubscribe from specific mailing lists, the recipient can also
*blacklist* themselves during the unsubscription process, meaning they will not receive *any* more
marketing emails from the Odoo database.

In order to provide recipients with the ability to blacklist themselves, a specific feature **must**
be enabled in the *Email Marketing* application.

Navigate to :menuselection:`Email Marketing app --> Configuration --> Settings`, and tick the
checkbox next to the :guilabel:`Blacklist Option when Unsubscribing` feature. Then, click
:guilabel:`Save` in the upper-left corner of the :guilabel:`Settings` page.

.. image:: unsubscriptions/blacklist-feature.png
   :align: center
   :alt: View of the blacklist feature in the Settings page of the Odoo Email Marketing app.

Unsubscribe
-----------

By default, an *Unsubscribe* link appears at the bottom of all mailing templates.

.. warning::
   The *Unsubscribe* link does **not** appear by default if the *Start From Scratch* template is
   used to create a mailing. The user **must** manually add the specific unsubscribe link
   `/unsubscribe_from_list` in the body of the email, or use a block from the *Footers* section of
   the email builder, which includes the unsubscribe link.

If a recipient clicks the *Unsubscribe* link in a mailing, Odoo instantly unsubscribes them from the
mailing list, presents them with a :guilabel:`Mailing Subscriptions` page where they can directly
manage their subscriptions, and informs them that they've been :guilabel:`Successfully
Unsubscribed`.

.. image:: unsubscriptions/mailing-subscriptions-page.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The Mailng Subscriptions page that appears when 'Unsubscribe' link in mailing is clicked.

Beneath that, Odoo asks the former subscriber to :guilabel:`Please let us know why you updated your
subscription`, and the user can proceed to choose the appropriate opt-out reason from a series of
options presented to them.

.. note::
   The opt-out answer options can be created and modified by navigating to :menuselection:`Email
   Marketing app --> Configuration --> Optout Reasons`.

Once they've chosen the appropriate opt-out reason from the options presented to them, they can
click the :guilabel:`Send` button. Odoo then logs their reasoning for unsubscribing in the *Email
Marketing* app for future analysis.

Blacklist
---------

For a recipient to remove (i.e. blacklist) themselves from **all** marketing emails during the
unsubscription process, on the :guilabel:`Mailing Subscriptions` page, they must click
:guilabel:`Exclude Me`.

Upon clicking :guilabel:`Exclude Me`, Odoo informs the recipient they have been successfully
blacklisted, with a message reading: :guilabel:`✔️ Email added to our blocklist`.

.. image:: unsubscriptions/mailing-subscriptions-blocklist-question.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The blocklist question on the Mailing Subscriptions page that recipients see.

Beneath that, Odoo asks the former subscriber to :guilabel:`Please let us know why you want to be
added to our blocklist`, and the user can proceed to choose the appropriate reason from a series of
options presented to them.

Once they've chosen the appropriate reason from the options presented to them, they can click the
:guilabel:`Send` button. Odoo then logs their reasoning for blacklisting themselves in the *Email
Marketing* app for future analysis.

Blacklisted email addresses
===========================

To view a complete list of all blacklisted email addresses, navigate to :menuselection:`Email
Marketing app --> Configuration --> Blacklisted Email Addresses`.

.. image:: unsubscriptions/blacklisted-email-addresses.png
   :align: center
   :alt: View of the blacklisted email addresses page in Odoo Email Marketing.

When a blacklisted record is selected from this list, Odoo reveals a separate page with the
recipient's contact information, along with the provided :guilabel:`Reason` why they chose to
blacklist themselves.

.. image:: unsubscriptions/blacklisted-contact-form.png
   :align: center
   :alt: View of a blacklisted contact detail form in Odoo Email Marketing.

In the *chatter* of the blacklisted record page, there's a time-stamped message, informing the user
when the recipient blacklisted themselves (via a :guilabel:`Mail Blacklist created` log note).

.. note::
   Blacklisted emails are excluded from all marketing mailings, however, these emails can still
   receive transactional emails, such as order confirmations, shipping notifications, etc.

Unblacklist contacts
====================

To *Unblacklist* contacts, click the :guilabel:`Unblacklist` button in the upper-left corner of a
blacklisted record's page to remove the contact from the blacklist, allowing them to receive
mailings once again.

When :guilabel:`Unblacklist` is clicked, an :guilabel:`Are you sure you want to unblacklist this
Email Address?` pop-up window appears.

In this pop-up window, the email address of the selected blacklisted record is shown, and there's a
:guilabel:`Reason` field, in which a reason can be entered, explaining why this particular contact
was removed from the blacklist.

.. image:: unsubscriptions/unblacklist-popup.png
   :align: center
   :alt: View of the unblacklist pop-up window in the Odoo Email Marketing application.

After filling in the fields, click :guilabel:`Confirm` to officially remove that particular contact
from the blacklist.

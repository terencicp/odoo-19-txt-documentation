Dashboard
=========

Upon opening the *Surveys* application, Odoo presents the main dashboard of the *Surveys*
application, otherwise known as the :guilabel:`Surveys` page.

.. image:: surveys/surveys-dashboard.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The Odoo Surveys application dashboard in the default Kanban view.

.. tip::
   The *Surveys* dashboard can be accessed at any time throughout the application by clicking
   :menuselection:`Surveys` from the header menu.

In the upper-left corner, there is a :guilabel:`New` button. When clicked, Odoo presents a blank
survey form that can be used to create a survey.

On the dashboard, all the surveys that have been created in the database are displayed in a default
Kanban view.

From left-to-right, after the survey name, the user who is responsible for it, and the month it was
created, each line on the *Surveys* dashboard shows the following:

- Number of :guilabel:`Questions` in that particular survey
- :guilabel:`Average Duration` of the survey (how long it typically takes a participant to complete)
- Number of :guilabel:`Registered` participants for the survey
- Number of times that particular survey has been :guilabel:`Completed`
- Percentage and data bar showcasing how many people have :guilabel:`Passed` or become
  :guilabel:`Certified`

  .. note::
     The :guilabel:`Passed` percentage and bar **only** appears when a *Required Score* has been
     configured for that particular survey.

     The :guilabel:`Certified` percentage and bar **only** appears if that particular survey has the
     *Is a Certification* option enabled on the survey form.

     If neither :guilabel:`Passed` nor :guilabel:`Certified` appear on the line, that indicates the
     survey is without a *Required Score* and was not enabled with the *Is a Certification* option.

- Number of :guilabel:`Courses` related to that survey, which **only** appears if more than one
  course has been created and attached to a single survey

.. note::
   A half-trophy background image behind the survey name indicates that the survey is a
   *Certification*.

To the far-right of those data points on the survey lines, located on the *Surveys* application
dashboard, are a collection of buttons.

Those buttons are as follows:

- :guilabel:`Share`: click to reveal a :guilabel:`Share a Survey` pop-up form that can be used to
  invite potential participants to the survey - complete with a :guilabel:`Survey Link` that can be
  copied and sent to potential participants, and a :guilabel:`Send by Email` toggle switch.

  When the :guilabel:`Send by Email` toggle is active (green switch), additional fields appear, in
  which :guilabel:`Recipients`, :guilabel:`Additional Emails`, and a :guilabel:`Subject` can be
  added to the email.

  Below that, a dynamic email template, complete with a :guilabel:`Start Certification` button
  appears, which can be modified, as well, if needed.

  :guilabel:`Attachments` can be added to the email, as well as an :guilabel:`Answer deadline` can
  be set, if needed.

  Once modifications are complete, click :guilabel:`Send` to send that email invite to all the email
  addresses/contacts listed in the :guilabel:`Recipients` field.

  .. image:: surveys/share-survey-popup-email-toggle.png
     :align: center
     :alt: The 'Share a Survey' pop-up window in Odoo Surveys with the Send by Email toggled on.

  .. tip::
     The default :guilabel:`Mail Template` for survey invites can be edited by navigating to
     :menuselection:`Settings --> Technical --> Email Templates` and searching for `Survey: Invite`.

  .. note::
     The :guilabel:`Send by Email` toggle switch is **not** present when the survey line has zero
     questions.

     The :guilabel:`Survey Link` only appears when the survey's *Access Mode* is set to *Anyone with
     the link*.

     The :guilabel:`Additional Emails` field only appears when the survey's *Require Login* field is
     **not** active.

- :guilabel:`Test`: click to take a test version of the survey in a new tab, from the point-of-view
  of a survey participant, in order to check for any errors or inconsistencies.
- :guilabel:`See results`: click to reveal a new tab showcasing detailed metrics and graphical
  representations of all survey participants, questions, and responses for deeper analysis.
- :guilabel:`Start Live Session`: click to initiate a *Live session* survey, and reveal a session
  manager window in a new tab. This button is **not** present for surveys that have enabled the *Is
  a Certification* option on the survey form.
- :guilabel:`End Live Session`: click to end a *Live session* survey that has been officially
  started. This button option **only** appears on survey lines that have previously initiated a live
  session.

Above the buttons that are located to the far-right of the survey lines, a :guilabel:`⋮ (three
dots)` icon appears when the cursor hovers over that particular line. When the :guilabel:`⋮ (three
dots)` icon is clicked, a drop-down menu with some configuration-related options appear:

The options are:

- :guilabel:`Edit Survey`: when clicked, Odoo reveals the survey form for that particular survey,
  which can then be modified in a number of different ways.
- :guilabel:`Share`: when clicked, Odoo reveals the :guilabel:`Share a Survey` pop-up form that can
  be used to invite potential participants to the survey.
- :guilabel:`Delete`: when clicked, Odoo presents a pop-up window, wherein the user **must** confirm
  they want to delete the survey entirely, which they can do by clicking the :guilabel:`Delete`
  button at the bottom of the pop-up window.
- :guilabel:`Color`: users can opt to choose a color to add to the survey line on the dashboard for
  added organizational purposes, if needed.

.. image:: surveys/three-dot-dropdown.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The three-dot drop-down menu of options that appears on the Odoo Surveys dashboard.

Beneath the buttons that are located to the far-right of the survey lines, there is an *Activities*
button, represented by a :guilabel:`🕘 (clock)` icon. When clicked, a mini pop-up window appears,
from which activities related to that particular survey can be scheduled and customized.

.. image:: surveys/schedule-activities-dropdown.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The Schedule Activities drop-down menu that appears on the Odoo Surveys dashboard.

List view
---------

The *Surveys* dashboard is shown in the Kanban view, by default, but there is also a list view
option available in the upper-right corner, represented by a :guilabel:`≣ (bars)` icon.

When the :guilabel:`≣ (bars)` icon is clicked, the survey related data is displayed in a list view.

.. image:: surveys/list-view.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The list view option located on the Odoo Surveys application dashboard.

The columns shown on the *Surveys* app dashboard, while in list view, are as follows:

- :guilabel:`Survey Title`
- :guilabel:`Responsible`
- :guilabel:`Average Duration`
- :guilabel:`Registered`
- :guilabel:`Success Ratio (%)`
- :guilabel:`Avg Score (%)`

.. tip::
   Additional columns can be added to the *Surveys* application dashboard, while in list view, by
   clicking the *additional options* drop-down menu, located to the far-right of the column titles,
   represented by a :guilabel:`(slider with two dots)` icon.

Activities view
---------------

To have the *Surveys* application dashboard display nothing but the activities associated to the
surveys in the database, click the :guilabel:`🕘 (clock)` icon to the far-right of the other view
options, located in the upper-right corner.

.. image:: surveys/activities-view.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The activities view option located on the Odoo Surveys dashboard.

Doing so reveals a table with rows and columns. The rows show the different surveys in the database,
and the columns depict the various activity types.

.. note::
   A new survey cannot be created in this view, as it is solely for the purpose of creating and
   viewing scheduled activities.

Survey analysis
===============

After surveys have been created and sent to participants, it is only a matter of time before the
responses start to come in. When they do, it is important to know where and how to analyze them in
the Odoo *Surveys* application.

Fortunately, Odoo provides numerous ways to view survey responses, allowing users to access and
analyze survey responses as they are submitted.

See results
===========

Upon opening the :menuselection:`Surveys` application, the main dashboard reveals a list of all the
surveys in the database, along with pertinent information related to each one.

By default, every survey line showcases its number of :guilabel:`Questions`, :guilabel:`Average
Duration`, and how many participants have :guilabel:`Registered` or :guilabel:`Completed` the
survey.

There are also elements showing the percentage of how many participants :guilabel:`Passed` (if a
*Required Score (%)* was configured), or how many participants became :guilabel:`Certified` (if the
*Is a Certification* option was configured).

.. note::
   To learn more about the different analytical elements found on the :guilabel:`Surveys` dashboard,
   check out the :doc:`Survey Essentials <../surveys/create>` documentation.

On the :guilabel:`Surveys` dashboard, to the far-right of each survey line displayed in the default
list view, there is a :guilabel:`See results` button.

.. image:: analysis/see-results-button.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The 'See Results' button present on the main dashboard of the Odoo Surveys application.

When the :guilabel:`See results` button is clicked, a new browser tab opens, revealing a separate
page filled with all of that particular survey's results and responses, with an informative
:guilabel:`Results Overview` and some filtering drop-down menus at the top.

.. image:: analysis/results-page.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Typical survey results page when 'See results' is clicked from the Odoo Surveys dashboard.

At the top of the page, there is an :guilabel:`Edit Survey` link, in the middle of a blue header
banner. When clicked, Odoo returns the user to the survey form for that particular survey.

Beneath that, is the title of the survey, and its description, if one was configured for it on its
survey form.

To the right of the survey title, there are two drop-down menus with various filtering options,
which can be used to personalize and segment the survey results in a number of different ways.

The first filter drop-down menu is set on the default :guilabel:`All Surveys` option, meaning the
results below are showing results and responses from all the submitted surveys, regardless if they
have been fully completed or not.

When that drop-down menu is clicked open, another option, :guilabel:`Completed surveys`, appears.

.. image:: analysis/all-surveys-dropdown.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The 'All surveys' drop-down menu opened on the 'See results' page of the Odoo Surveys app.

With that drop-down menu open, the number corresponding to each filter option appears to the right
of each option.

To the right of that drop-down menu of filter options, is another drop-down menu of filter options
that can be used to further customize the results showcased on this page.

That drop-down menu is set to the :guilabel:`Passed and Failed` option, by default. This option
shows the results and responses from all participants who have passed or failed this particular
survey.

.. note::
   This second drop-down menu of filter options **only** appears if the survey being analyzed has a
   *Scoring* option configured, or if the *Is a Certification* feature has been enabled.

When that second drop-down menu of filter options is clicked open, two additional options appear:
:guilabel:`Passed only` and :guilabel:`Failed only`.

.. image:: analysis/passed-failed-dropdown.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The 'Passed and Failed' drop-down menu on the 'See results' page of the Odoo Surveys app.

Each option would filter the results below to only show responses from participants who have passed
the survey, or who have failed the survey, respectively.

Directly beneath the survey title, there is a :guilabel:`Print` button. When clicked, the entire
results page can be printed.

The :guilabel:`Results Overview` section is below the survey title, filter option drop-down menus,
and :guilabel:`Print` button.

.. image:: analysis/results-overview.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The 'Results Overview' section on the 'See results' page in the Odoo Surveys application.

This section of the results page provides a summarized collection of useful survey-related data and
metrics for quick analysis.

Question analysis
-----------------

Directly beneath the :guilabel:`Results Overview` section is where the results and responses of the
survey are found.

.. note::
   The various sections of the survey, if there were any, appear at the top of their corresponding
   questions on the results page, as well, for added organization.

Every question that was a part of the survey is shown, along with an in-depth breakdown, and visual
representation, of how it was answered by participants, beneath the :guilabel:`Results Overview`
section.

Each question is displayed above its corresponding results. To the left of the question is an
:guilabel:`👁️ (eye)` icon. When clicked, Odoo hides the visual and data-related results and
responses. When clicked again, that question's visual and data-related results re-appear.

To the far-right of the question, there are indicators to see how many participants
:guilabel:`Responded` and how many :guilabel:`Skipped` the question.

.. image:: analysis/responded-skipped-indicators.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The Responded and Skipped indicators on the 'See results' page in Odoo Surveys.

If the question required the participant to enter in their own answer, without any options to choose
from, like entering a specific number or date, for example, there is also an indicator to showcase
how many users answered the question :guilabel:`Correct`.

.. image:: analysis/correct-indicator.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Sample of a 'correct' indicator on the 'See results' page in the Odoo Surveys application.

.. note::
   Even if there is no configured *correct* response for question of this nature, the
   :guilabel:`Correct` indicator still appears, although, it displays a `0`.

   This would occur for opinion-based questions, like `When would be a good time to hold another
   sale?`

If there is only one correct response to a multiple choice question, those results and responses are
represented by a :guilabel:`Pie Graph`. The correct answer is indicated by a :guilabel:`✔️
(checkmark)` icon next to the correct answer option, in the legend above the graph.

.. image:: analysis/pie-graph-results.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Typical pie graph results on the 'See results' page in the Odoo Surveys application.

If there are multiple correct answer options (or no correct answers at all) for a multiple choice
question, those results and responses are represented by a :guilabel:`Bar Graph`.

.. image:: analysis/bar-graph-results.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Typical bar graph results on the 'See results' page in the Odoo Surveys application.

Each multiple choice question has a :guilabel:`Graph` tab and an :guilabel:`Data` tab. The
graph-related tab is shown by default.

The :guilabel:`Data` tab shows all the provided :guilabel:`Answer` options for the question. The
:guilabel:`User Choice` (with percentages and votes) along with the :guilabel:`Score` of each
option.

.. image:: analysis/data-tab.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Typical 'Data' tab on the 'See results' page in the Odoo Surveys application.

Other question types, wherein there were no answer options for the participant to choose from, there
is a :guilabel:`Most Common` tab and an :guilabel:`All Data` tab.

The :guilabel:`Most Common` tab shows the :guilabel:`User Responses`, the :guilabel:`Occurrence`,
and the :guilabel:`Score` (if applicable).

.. image:: analysis/most-common-tab.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Typical 'Most Common' tab on the 'See results' page in the Odoo Surveys application.

The :guilabel:`All Data` tab shows a list of all the submitted responses to that particular
question.

.. image:: analysis/all-data-tab.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Typical 'All Data' tab on the 'See results' page in the Odoo Surveys application.

If a question is looking for participants to enter a numerical value as a response,
:guilabel:`Maximum`, :guilabel:`Minimum`, and :guilabel:`Average` indicators appear to the far-right
of the results tabs.

.. image:: analysis/max-min-avg-indicator.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The Maximum, Minimum, and Average indicators on the 'See results' page in Odoo Surveys.

A :guilabel:`filter` icon is also present either to the right of the :guilabel:`User Choice` column
in a :guilabel:`Data` tab, or to the far-right of a :guilabel:`User Response` line in an
:guilabel:`All Data` tab.

.. image:: analysis/filter-icon.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Typical 'Filter' icon on the 'See results' page in the Odoo Surveys application.

When that :guilabel:`filter` icon is clicked, Odoo returns the user to the top of the results page,
with that chosen filter applied, showing the results of each question for participants who submitted
that particular answer for that specific question.

.. image:: analysis/applied-filter.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The applied filter on the 'See results' page in the Odoo Surveys application.

Therefore, showcasing the remaining results for participants who answered that specific question in
the same way. To remove that filter, and reveal all the results once again, click :guilabel:`Remove
all filters` or click the :guilabel:`✖️ (X)` icon in the filter box at the top of the results page.

Participations
==============

To view a consolidated list of participation results for a specific survey, navigate to
:menuselection:`Surveys app`, select the desired survey from the list, and click the
:guilabel:`Participations` smart button at the top of the survey form.

.. image:: analysis/participations-smart-button.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The Participations smart button at the top of a survey form in Odoo Surveys.

Doing so reveals a separate :guilabel:`Participations` page, showcasing the participants for that
specific survey, along with a collection of pertinent information related to each one.

.. image:: analysis/participations-page-singular-survey.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The Participations page for a singular survey in the Odoo Surveys application.

Here, users can view information related to individual participants who took that specific survey.
If they desire to see a more detailed breakdown of their various answers and responses, they can
click on any participant, and Odoo reveals a separate page showing that participant's survey
details, along with their submitted answers.

.. image:: analysis/individual-participant-page.png
   :align: center
   :alt: An individual participant's detail form in the Odoo Surveys application.

To view a consolidated list of all participants of every survey in the database, navigate to
:menuselection:`Surveys app --> Participations`. Here, every survey in the database is shown in a
default nested list. Beside each survey title has the number of participants in parenthesis.

.. image:: analysis/participations-page-all-surveys.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The Participations page for all surveys in the Odoo Surveys application.

When a survey is un-nested from this list, by clicking the survey title, the corresponding
participants, along with their response-related data for that survey, appear on the page.

The :guilabel:`Participations` page can also be viewed in a Kanban layout, as well.

Create surveys
==============

To create a survey in the Odoo *Surveys* application, navigate to :menuselection:`Surveys app -->
New` to reveal a blank survey form.

.. note::
   The :guilabel:`New` button is **not** present on the *Surveys* dashboard if in the *Activities*
   view.

Survey form
===========

.. image:: create/blank-survey-form.png
   :align: center
   :alt: How a blank survey form looks in the Odoo Surveys application.

At the top of the survey form are four radio buttons, each representing a survey style. The radio
button options are:

- :guilabel:`Survey`
- :guilabel:`Live Session`
- :guilabel:`Assessment`
- :guilabel:`Custom` (selected by default)

These options are here to streamline the survey-making process, by providing users with automated
settings and options that are ideally specific to those types of surveys. Each of those survey type
options comes equipped with its own specific selection of options.

The :guilabel:`Custom` option, selected by default, offers all the options from every potential
survey type (located in the :guilabel:`Options` tab).

Beneath those radio survey type options is a blank field in which a name for the survey **must** be
entered.

Below the survey name field, is the :guilabel:`Responsible` field. Choose a user from the drop-down
menu to be in charge of the survey. By default, the user who initially created the survey is
selected as the default :guilabel:`Responsible`.

To the right of those fields, and above the tabs, is the option to add a background image,
represented by a :guilabel:`📷 (camera)` icon. When clicked, the option to upload an image becomes
available. This image would be used as the background image for the entire survey. This is **not** a
required option.

Below those fields and options are four tabs: :guilabel:`Questions`, :guilabel:`Options`,
:guilabel:`Description`, and :guilabel:`End Message`.

Questions tab
-------------

View, access, add, and/or delete questions and sections to the survey in the :guilabel:`Questions`
tab.

By default, two columns are present in the :guilabel:`Questions` tab: :guilabel:`Title` (i.e. the
question) and :guilabel:`Question Type`.

If the :guilabel:`Randomized per Section` option is enabled in the :guilabel:`Options` tab of the
survey form, a column titled, :guilabel:`# Questions Randomly Picked` appears in the
:guilabel:`Questions` tab.

Indicate whether questions require a mandatory answer by clicking the :guilabel:`(optional columns)`
icon to the far-right of the column titles. Then, select :guilabel:`Mandatory Answer` from the
drop-down menu to reveal the :guilabel:`Mandatory Answer` column in the :guilabel:`Questions` tab.

.. image:: create/mandatory-answer-dropdown.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The slider drop-down menu with the Mandatory Answer option selected in Odoo Surveys.

Add a question
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add a question to a survey, click :guilabel:`Add a question` in the :guilabel:`Questions` tab,
and proceed to fill out the :guilabel:`Create Sections and Questions` pop-up window that appears.

To learn how to create and customize questions, refer to the :doc:`create questions <questions>`
documentation.

.. important::
   There **must** be a survey title entered in order for the :guilabel:`Create Sections and
   Questions` pop-up window to appear. If no title is entered for the survey, an error pop-up
   message appears in the upper-right corner, instructing the user to enter a survey title.

Add a section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A *section* divides the survey into organized parts, in order to visually group similar questions
together. To make a section, click :guilabel:`Add a section` at the bottom of the
:guilabel:`Questions` tab, proceed to type in a desired name for the section, then either press
:kbd:`Enter` or click away.

The section line appears in dark gray in the :guilabel:`Questions` tab.

Then, drag-and-drop desired questions beneath a section, or drag-and-drop a section title on top of
(i.e. *before*) the desired question(s) in the survey. Doing so populates the section with questions
that align with its theme.

If the :guilabel:`Randomized per Section` option is enabled in the :guilabel:`Options` tab of the
survey form, the number `1` appears, by default, on the section line, beneath the :guilabel:`#
Questions Randomly Picked` column.

This indicates that `1` question from that section will be picked at random for each participant
taking the survey, bypassing every other, non-chosen question from that section. To change that
number, select that figure, and type in the desired number in its place. Then, either press
:kbd:`Enter`, or click away.

Options tab
-----------

In the :guilabel:`Options` tab of the survey form, there are many options to choose from, separated
in four different sections: :guilabel:`Questions`, :guilabel:`Time & Scoring`,
:guilabel:`Participants`, and :guilabel:`Live Session`.

The options available in this tab vary on the survey type chosen, via the radio buttons at the top
of the survey form: :guilabel:`Survey`, :guilabel:`Live Session`, :guilabel:`Assessment`, or
:guilabel:`Custom`.

The :guilabel:`Custom` survey type showcases all the possible options in the :guilabel:`Options`
tab. So, if any of the following options do **not** appear in the :guilabel:`Options` tab, it is
likely because the selected survey type does not offer it.

Questions section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: create/questions-section-options-tab.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The Questions section of the Options tab on a survey form in Odoo Surveys.

The first field in the :guilabel:`Questions` section revolves around the :guilabel:`Pagination`,
or overall layout, of the survey.

Choose between :guilabel:`One page per question`, :guilabel:`One page per section`, or
:guilabel:`One page with all the questions` in the :guilabel:`Pagination` field.

.. note::
   If :guilabel:`One page with all the questions` is selected, all the remaining options in the
   :guilabel:`Questions` field, apart from :guilabel:`Question Selection` is removed, as they are no
   longer needed.

Next, select one of the following options in the :guilabel:`Display Progress as` field:

- :guilabel:`Percentage left`: displays the percentage of the survey remaining to participants.
- :guilabel:`Number`: display the number of questions answered along with the total number of
  questions to answer.

In the :guilabel:`Question Selection` field choose to have the survey show :guilabel:`All questions`
or :guilabel:`Randomized per Section`. If :guilabel:`Randomized per Section` a new column appears in
the :guilabel:`Questions` tab, titled: :guilabel:`# Questions Randomly Picked`.

In the :guilabel:`# Questions Randomly Picked` column, designate how many questions, in that
particular section, should be chosen at random to the participant.

Lastly, there is the :guilabel:`Allow Roaming` option. When enabled, participants are able to
navigate back to previous pages in the survey.

Time & Scoring section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: create/time-scoring-section-options-tab.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The Time and Scoring section of the Options tab on a survey form in Odoo Surveys.

The first option in the :guilabel:`Time & Scoring` section is the :guilabel:`Survey Time Limit`
option. If enabled, proceed to enter in an amount of time (in :guilabel:`minutes`) to be set as the
time limit for the survey.

Next, in the :guilabel:`Scoring` section, determine whether there should be: :guilabel:`No scoring`,
:guilabel:`Scoring with answers after each page`, :guilabel:`Scoring with answers at the end`, or
:guilabel:`Scoring without answers`.

If the :guilabel:`No scoring` option is selected, no other options are available in this section.
However, if any *other* :guilabel:`Scoring` option is selected, two additional fields appear:
:guilabel:`Required Score (%)` and :guilabel:`Is a Certification`.

In the :guilabel:`Required Score (%)` field, enter the minimum percentage participants **must** earn
in order to pass the survey. Scores below this threshold are considered fails. This figure is also
used to determine if a participant is 'certified' or not, if the :guilabel:`Is a Certification`
option is enabled.

If the :guilabel:`Is a Certification` option is enabled, that makes the survey a *Certification*,
which is represented on the main *Surveys* app dashboard via a half-tropy image behind the survey
title, while in the default Kanban view. Or, via a full-trophy icon, while in list view.

When the :guilabel:`Is a Certification` option is enabled, three additional fields appear -- one
beside the option, and two below.

In the field that appears beside the option, users can select (and :guilabel:`Preview`) a
certification template.

Beneath that, in the :guilabel:`Certified Email Template` field, users can select a preconfigured
email template, or create one on-the-fly, to be sent to certified participants of the survey upon
completion.

Lastly, if the :guilabel:`Give Badge` field is enabled, a preconfigured badge is then displayed on
the contact page for that certified survey participant.

Participants section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: create/participants-section-options-tab.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The Participants section of the Options tab on a survey form in Odoo Surveys.

The first available option in the :guilabel:`Participants` section is the :guilabel:`Access Mode`
field. This is where users can determine who has access to the survey. Users can select either:
:guilabel:`Anyone with the link` or :guilabel:`Invited people only`.

Next, there is the option to :guilabel:`Require Login`. Enabling this feature means users **must**
login before being able to take the survey, even if they have a valid token.

Lastly, in there is the :guilabel:`Limit Attempts` field. If enabled, an additional field appears
beside it, in which users can determine how many times users can attempt this survey.

Live Session section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: create/live-session-section-options-tab.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The Live Session section of the Options tab on a survey form in Odoo Surveys.

.. note::
   The :guilabel:`Live Session` section in the :guilabel:`Options` tab of the survey form **only**
   pertains to *Live Session* surveys.

The first option in the :guilabel:`Live Session` section is the :guilabel:`Session Code` field. In
this field, enter a custom code, consisting of letters, numbers, and/or symbols, to be used by
participants in order to access the live session survey.

Next, is the :guilabel:`Session Link` field, which **cannot** be customized, but it *can* be sent
out to potential participants.

.. note::
   If a :guilabel:`Session Code` has been entered, the URL in the :guilabel:`Session Link` field
   ends with that specific :guilabel:`Session Code`.

   If that complete :guilabel:`Session Link` (ending in the custom :guilabel:`Session Code`) is used
   by participants to access the live session survey, that link would *already* be entered for them.
   At that point, they'd simply have to wait until the host of the live session begins the survey,
   and then they'd be able to enter.

   If the :guilabel:`Session Link` (ending in the custom :guilabel:`Session Code`) is sent
   **without** including the :guilabel:`Session Code` ending, participants trying to access the live
   session, via that link, will need to enter the custom :guilabel:`Session Code` to gain access.

   If the :guilabel:`Session Code` field is empty, a slightly longer, more complicated URL populates
   the :guilabel:`Session Link` field. When participants attempt to access the live session via that
   link (without a configured :guilabel:`Session Code`), all they have to do is wait for the host of
   the live session to begin the survey, and they'd be able to participate.

Lastly, in the :guilabel:`Live Session` section, there is the option to :guilabel:`Reward quick
answers`. If that option is enabled, participants who submit their answer quickly receive more
points.

   :doc:`live_session`

Description tab
---------------

In this non-required tab, users can enter a custom description about the survey, along with any
explanations or guidance that a survey participant may need in order to properly participate (and
complete) the survey.

End Message tab
---------------

In this non-required tab, users can enter a custom message that participants see upon completing the
survey.

Survey form buttons
===================

Once the survey has been configured properly, and questions have been added, the user can utilize
any of the available buttons in the upper-left corner of the survey form.

.. image:: create/survey-form-buttons.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The various buttons on a survey form in Odoo Surveys.

Those buttons are the following:

- :guilabel:`Share`: click to reveal a :guilabel:`Share a Survey` pop-up form that can be used to
  invite potential participants to the survey — complete with a :guilabel:`Survey Link` that can be
  copied and sent to potential participants, and a :guilabel:`Send by Email` toggle switch.

  .. image:: create/share-survey-popup.png
     :align: center
     :alt: The 'Share a Survey' pop-up window that appears in the Odoo Surveys application.

  When the :guilabel:`Send by Email` toggle is in the 'on' position, indicated by a green switch,
  additional fields appear, in which :guilabel:`Recipients` and a :guilabel:`Subject` can be added
  to the email. Below that, a dynamic email template, complete with a :guilabel:`Start
  Certification` button appears, which can also be modified.

  .. image:: create/share-survey-popup-email-toggle.png
     :align: center
     :alt: The 'Share a Survey' pop-up window in Odoo Surveys with the Send by Email toggled on.

  Once modifications are complete, click :guilabel:`Send` to send that email invite to all the email
  addresses/contacts listed in the :guilabel:`Recipients` field.
- :guilabel:`See results`: this button **only** appears if there has been at least one participant
  who has completed the survey. Clicking :guilabel:`See results` reveals a separate tab containing
  a visual analysis of the survey questions and responses. For more information, check out the
  :doc:`scoring surveys <scoring>` documentation.
- :guilabel:`Create Live Session`: clicking this button opens the *Session Manager* in a separate
  tab. It also allows participants to access the live session, but the actual survey does **not**
  begin until the user hosting the live session survey clicks the :guilabel:`Start` button on the
  *Session Manager* window.

  Additionally, when :guilabel:`Create Live Session` has been clicked, and the *Session Manager* tab
  has been opened, the :guilabel:`Create Live Session` button on the survey form is replaced with
  two new buttons: :guilabel:`Open Session Manager` and :guilabel:`Close Live Session`.

  Clicking :guilabel:`Open Session Manager` opens another separate tab to the *Session Manager*, and
  clicking :guilabel:`Close Live Session` closes, and subsequently ends, the live session.
- :guilabel:`Test`: clicking this button opens a new tab to a test version of the survey, in order
  for the user to check for errors or inconsistencies, from the point-of-view of a participant.
  Users can tell if they are in a test version of the survey if there is a blue banner at the top of
  the screen, reading: `This is a Test Survey --> Edit Survey`.

  If the link in the blue banner is clicked, Odoo returns the user to the survey form.
- :guilabel:`Print`: clicking this button opens a new tab to a printable version of the survey that
  the user can proceed to print for their records.
- :guilabel:`Close`: clicking this button closes the survey (i.e. archives it), which is represented
  by a red :guilabel:`Archived` banner across the top-right corner of the survey form.

  When this button is clicked, and the survey is closed, a single button appears in the upper-right
  corner of the survey form, titled: :guilabel:`Reopen`. When :guilabel:`Reopen` is clicked the
  survey is reopened (i.e. unarchived), and the :guilabel:`Archived` banner is removed from the
  survey form.

Live Session surveys
====================

With the Odoo *Surveys* application, users can enhance in-person demonstrations and presentations
with the *Live Session* feature.

*Live Session* surveys function the same way as a normal survey, but with a host or moderator, who
presents the questions to participants, reveals their responses in real-time, and controls the tempo
of the survey.

In *Live Session* surveys, participants access the survey experience via a custom URL, and sign in
with an optional access code. When the survey has begun, the host presents one question at a time.

Then, the audience of participants submit their answer, either via their computer or mobile device,
and once the responses have been gathered, the host reveals all the participant's responses, in real
time, with each answer's results displayed as a bar graph.

.. image:: live_session/live-session-concept-sample.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Rendered concept of how a Live Session question and answer result appears in Odoo Surveys.

Create Live Session survey
==========================

To create a *Live Session* survey, begin by opening the *Surveys* application. From the
:guilabel:`Surveys` dashboard, click the :guilabel:`New` button to reveal a blank survey form.

Any of the survey type options (:guilabel:`Survey`, :guilabel:`Live Session`,
:guilabel:`Assessment`, or :guilabel:`Custom`), presented as radio buttons at the top of the survey,
can be used to create a *Live Session*.

However, selecting the :guilabel:`Live Session` survey type radio button streamlines the process
because Odoo auto-selects the optimal settings and options for a *Live Session* survey when that
option is selected.

.. important::
   If the :guilabel:`Is a Certification` option is enabled in the :guilabel:`Options` tab, the
   survey **cannot** be used as a *Live Session* survey.

With the desired survey radio button option selected, proceed to :doc:`create a survey
<../surveys/create>` with :doc:`questions and sections <../surveys/questions>`.

While creating questions for the *Live Session* survey, open the :guilabel:`Options` tab on the
:guilabel:`Create Sections and Questions` pop-up form, in order to reveal the :guilabel:`Live
Sessions` section, which only has one available feature: :guilabel:`Question Time Limit`.

When the :guilabel:`Question Time Limit` option is enabled, a new field appears beside it, wherein
the user **must** enter the desired amount of time (in seconds) the participant gets to answer the
question.

.. image:: live_session/question-time-limit-option.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The Live Session question time limit option for questions in the Odoo Surveys application.

Options tab
-----------

After the questions have been created for the *Live Session* survey, open the :guilabel:`Options`
tab of the survey form to further configure the survey.

The :guilabel:`Options` tab is organized into four sections: :guilabel:`Questions`, :guilabel:`Time
& Scoring`, :guilabel:`Participants`, and :guilabel:`Live Session`.

Questions section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Regardless of the option selected for the :guilabel:`Pagination` field, the *Live Session* survey
*only* shows :guilabel:`One page per question`, and will default to that option when the
:guilabel:`Create Live Session` button is clicked, and a *Live Session* survey officially begins.

.. note::
   The :guilabel:`One page per question` option in the :guilabel:`Pagination` field is selected by
   default, and no other options appear in the :guilabel:`Questions` section, when the
   :guilabel:`Live Session` survey type radio button is selected.

The :guilabel:`Display Progress as` and :guilabel:`Question Selection` options are still viable and
active options for *Live Session* surveys, if desired, but they are **not** required.

However, the :guilabel:`Allow Roaming` feature is **not** available during *Live Session* surveys
whatsoever, as the host/moderator controls the survey, and participants have no control over what
question they see, or when they see it.

Time & Scoring section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :guilabel:`Survey Time Limit` option is **not** applicable for *Live Session* surveys. This
option does not even appear in the :guilabel:`Time & Scoring` section of the :guilabel:`Options` tab
if the :guilabel:`Live Session` survey type radio button option is selected.

.. note::
   While the :guilabel:`Survey Time Limit` option is not applicable for *Live Session* surveys, each
   question *can* be affixed with its own *Question Time Limit*, via the *Options* tab of the
   question pop-up form. Those question-specific time limits *do* work with *Live Session* surveys.

If desired, any :guilabel:`Scoring` option, and subsequent :guilabel:`Required Score (%)` option are
available to use with *Live Session* surveys.

However, if the :guilabel:`Is a Certification` option is enabled, the survey **cannot** be used as a
*Live Session* survey. The :guilabel:`Is a Certification` option does **not** appear in the
:guilabel:`Time & Scoring` section of the :guilabel:`Options` tab if the :guilabel:`Live Session`
survey type radio button option is selected.

Participants section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :guilabel:`Access Mode` field is set to the :guilabel:`Anyone with the link` option when the
survey is used as a *Live Session*. The :guilabel:`Anyone with the link` option **cannot** be
modified if the :guilabel:`Live Session` survey type radio button option is selected.

The :guilabel:`Require Login` option is available for *Live Session* surveys. However, if the
:guilabel:`Live Session` survey type radio button option is selected, the usual :guilabel:`Limit
Attempts` field that appears when :guilabel:`Require Login` is enabled does **not** appear, as live
session participants only get to attempt the survey once, as the host leads them through it.

Live Session section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :guilabel:`Session Code` field allows users to create unique codes for participants to use, in
order to gain access to the *Live Session* survey. This code can consist of any combination of
letters, numbers, and/or symbols.

The :guilabel:`Session Code` field is **not** required, however, it is encouraged because it adds a
level of exclusivity to the survey and, without a :guilabel:`Session Code`, the URL that appears in
the following :guilabel:`Session Link` field becomes far more complex.

.. important::
   If a :guilabel:`Session Code` is **not** entered, participants can access the survey, via the
   :guilabel:`Session Link` without needing a host, and the fundamental elements of the *Live
   Session* are lost, as the survey is then just a normal questionnaire, without any real-time
   results.

With a :guilabel:`Session Code`, the URL in the non-modifiable :guilabel:`Session Link` field is
simplified, and ends with the :guilabel:`Session Code`, preceded by `/s/`.

.. example::
   If `1212` has been entered as the :guilabel:`Session Code`, the URL in the :guilabel:`Session
   Link` field begins with the basic URL of the database (e.g. `sample-database.odoo.com`), followed
   by: `/s/1212`.

   So, collectively, that sample :guilabel:`Session Link` would be:
   `sample-database.odoo.com/s/1212`.

.. tip::
   If a user sends out the :guilabel:`Session Link` URL in its complete form - :guilabel:`Session
   Code` and all - participants would *not* need to enter in a code, as it would already be entered
   for them. That complete link places the participant in a virtual waiting room, where they simply
   need to wait for the host to officially start the *Live Session* survey.

   If a user sends out the :guilabel:`Session Link` URL - *except* for the :guilabel:`Session Code`
   at the end (i.e. the entire URL *through* `.../s/`) - participants would be taken to a page,
   wherein they would need to enter the specific :guilabel:`Session Code` in order to access the
   *Live Session*.

If any :guilabel:`Scoring` option has been enabled, the opportunity to :guilabel:`Reward quick
answers` is also available with *Live Session* surveys.

Start Live Session surveys
==========================

Once all the questions and configurations are complete, users can click the :guilabel:`Create Live
Session` button at the top of the survey form. Doing so opens a new browser tab to the *Session
Manager*.

When the :guilabel:`Create Live Session` button has been clicked, and the *Live Session* has begun,
a new :guilabel:`Open Session Manager` button appears on the survey form, which opens a new browser
tab to the *Session Manager*. If the *Live Session* has already begun, that button leads the user to
the question or section the *Live Session* is currently on.

Additionally, a :guilabel:`Close Live Session` button appears on the survey form. When that button
is clicked, the *Live Session* survey closes.

The *Session Manager* is controlled by the host/moderator of the *Live Session* survey, and is
typically shown on a projection or screen, so the participants can collectively view the questions
and real-time responses, as the host/moderator guides them through the *Live Session*.

.. note::
   The participant can see and answer the questions from their computer or mobile device, but the
   results and real-time responses can **only** be seen on the *Session Manager*.

Initially, the *Session Manager* shows the title of the *Live Session* survey, the link needed to
access it, and a :guilabel:`Waiting for attendees...` counter, which populates as participants enter
the *Live Session* survey.

Once the desired amount of participants have entered the *Live Session* survey, the host/moderator
can click the :guilabel:`Start` button on the right side of the *Session Manager* window to begin
the *Live Session*.

.. note::
   If the survey begins with a section title on the survey form, that section title appears in the
   *Session Manager*, and the participant's view of the survey informs them to `Pay attention to the
   host screen until the next question`. This message appears whenever a section title appears
   during a *Live Session*.

When the first question appears on the survey, the *Session Manager* shows the question above an
empty bar graph, showing the potential answer options on the x-axis. The participants see the
question and selectable answer options on their computer or mobile device.

As participants submit their answers, a progress bar, in the upper-left corner of the *Session
Manager*, fills in. This is how *Live Session* hosts/moderators know when every participant has
submitted their responses.

Then, when the desired amount of participants have submitted their responses, the host/moderator
clicks the :guilabel:`Show Results` button on the right side of the *Session Manager* to reveal the
collective real-time responses on the bar graph.

Once the host/moderator feels like the participants have had enough time to view the real-time
results, via the populated bar graph, they can click the :guilabel:`Show Correct Answer(s)` button
on the right side of the *Session Manager* window. Doing so highlights the correct response, if one
has been designated, in green. All incorrect responses are highlighted in red.

When the host/moderator feels the participants have had enough time to take in the correct and
incorrect responses, via the bar graph on the *Session Manager*, they can click the
:guilabel:`Next` button to move on to the next portion of the survey.

Repeat this process until the survey is complete.

Create questions
================

In Odoo *Surveys*, crafting and tailoring survey questions is crucial for :doc:`creating and
customizing surveys <../surveys/create>`.

Fortunately, Odoo provides numerous ways to configure tailored questions for any kind of survey.

To access a list of *all* the questions that have been created in the database, navigate to
:menuselection:`Surveys app --> Questions & Answers --> Questions`. There, users can view and modify
any question from any survey.

However, there is only one place in the Odoo *Surveys* application where survey questions can be
created. To do that, navigate to a survey form, by going to :menuselection:`Surveys app --> New`, or
by selecting any pre-existing survey from the :guilabel:`Surveys` page (:menuselection:`Surveys app
--> Surveys`).

Questions tab
=============

On a survey form, users can view, access, add, and/or delete questions (and sections) in the
:guilabel:`Questions` tab.

By default, two columns are present in the :guilabel:`Questions` tab: :guilabel:`Title` (i.e. the
question) and :guilabel:`Question Type`.

If the :guilabel:`Randomized per Section` option is enabled in the :guilabel:`Options` tab of the
survey form, a column titled, :guilabel:`# Questions Randomly Picked` appears in the
:guilabel:`Questions` tab.

To reveal the :guilabel:`Mandatory Answer` column on the :guilabel:`Questions` tab, which indicates
if questions require a mandatory answer or not, click the :guilabel:`(optional columns)` icon
located to the far-right of the column titles.

.. image:: questions/slider-dropdown-mandatory-answer.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The slider drop-down menu showing the Mandatory Answer option in Odoo Surveys.

Create sections
---------------

A *section* divides the survey into organized parts, in order to visually group similar questions
together. To make a section, click :guilabel:`Add a section` at the bottom of the
:guilabel:`Questions` tab, proceed to type in a desired name for the section, then either press
:kbd:`Enter` or click away.

The section line appears in dark gray in the :guilabel:`Questions` tab.

Then, drag-and-drop desired questions beneath a section, or drag-and-drop a section title on top of
(i.e. *before*) the desired question(s) in the survey, in order to populate the section with
specific questions that fit the theme of the section.

If the :guilabel:`Randomized per Section` option is enabled in the :guilabel:`Options` tab of the
survey form, the number `1` appears, by default, on the section line, beneath the :guilabel:`#
Questions Randomly Picked` column.

This indicates that `1` question from that section will be picked at random for each participant
taking the survey, bypassing every other, non-chosen question from that section. To change that
number, select that figure, and type in the desired number in its place. Then, either press
:kbd:`Enter`, or click away.

Create questions
================

To create questions for the survey, click :guilabel:`Add a question` in the :guilabel:`Questions`
tab.

Clicking :guilabel:`Add a question` opens the :guilabel:`Create Sections and Questions` pop-up
window, in which a survey question can be created.

.. important::
   There **must** be a survey title entered in order for the :guilabel:`Create Sections and
   Questions` pop-up window to appear. If no title is entered for the survey, an error pop-up
   message appears in the upper-right corner, instructing the user to enter a survey title.

When all desired configurations are complete click either :guilabel:`Save & Close` to save the
question and return to the survey form, or :guilabel:`Save & New` to save the question and create a
new one right away in a fresh :guilabel:`Create Sections and Questions` pop-up window.

Click :guilabel:`Discard` to discard the question entirely.

Create Sections and Questions pop-up window
-------------------------------------------

.. image:: questions/create-sections-questions-popup.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The Create Sections and Questions pop-up form in Odoo Surveys.

In the :guilabel:`Create Sections and Questions` pop-up window, start by typing the question into
the :guilabel:`Question` field, located at the top of the pop-up window.

Then, choose the desired :guilabel:`Question Type`. A preview of each :guilabel:`Question Type` is
to the right of the :guilabel:`Question Type` field, when a :guilabel:`Question Type` is selected.

Choose from the following :guilabel:`Question Types`:

- :guilabel:`Multiple choice: only one answer`: a multiple choice question, where only one answer is
  permitted.
- :guilabel:`Multiple choice: multiple answers allowed`: a multiple choice question, where more than
  answer is permitted.
- :guilabel:`Multiple Lines Text Box`: an open-ended question, where participants can type in a
  multiple line response.
- :guilabel:`Single Line Text Box`: an open-ended question, where participants can type in a single
  line response.
- :guilabel:`Numerical Value`: a number-based question, where participants must enter a number as a
  response.
- :guilabel:`Date`: a date-based question, where participants must enter a date (year-month-day) as
  a response.
- :guilabel:`Datetime`: a date-based question, where participants must enter a date *and* time
  (year-month-day, hour-minute-second) as a response.
- :guilabel:`Matrix`: a multiple-choice, multiple question, in a table/chart layout, where
  participants are presented with different questions on each row, and different answer options on
  each column.

.. note::
   Different features appear in the :guilabel:`Answers` and :guilabel:`Options` tabs, depending on
   the chosen :guilabel:`Question Type`.

   However, the :guilabel:`Description` tab **always** remains the same, regardless of the question
   type chosen.

Once a :guilabel:`Question Type` has been selected, there are three possible tabs where information
can be customized for the question. These include the :guilabel:`Answers` tab (if applicable for the
chosen :guilabel:`Question Type`), the :guilabel:`Description` tab, and the :guilabel:`Options` tab.

Each tab offers a variety of different features, depending on what :guilabel:`Question Type` was
chosen.

Answers tab
~~~~~~~~~~~

The :guilabel:`Answers` tab **only** appears if the selected :guilabel:`Question Type` provides
answer options to the participant.

However, if a custom response is required to answer the selected :guilabel:`Question Type`, like a
:guilabel:`Multiple Lines Text Box`, for example. Or, if the answer to the :guilabel:`Question Type`
is a number, date, or datetime, the :guilabel:`Answers` tab disappears completely.

If the :guilabel:`Single Line Text Box` is selected as the :guilabel:`Question Type`, the
:guilabel:`Answers` tab remains, although it only provides two checkbox options: :guilabel:`Input
must be an email` and :guilabel:`Save as user nickname`.

.. image:: questions/single-line-answer-tab.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The Single Line Text box question type answers tab in Odoo Surveys.

If the :guilabel:`Input must be an email` option is enabled, a new field, :guilabel:`Save as user
email` appears. If that box is ticked, Odoo saves the participant's answer to that specific question
as their email address.

If the :guilabel:`Save as user nickname` option is enabled, Odoo saves the participant's answer as
its nickname.

For all other applicable :guilabel:`Question Type` options that provide answer options to the
participant, the :guilabel:`Answers` tab appears the same.

.. image:: questions/multiple-choice-answer-options.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The answer tab with a multiple choice answer option selected in Odoo Surveys.

From here, users can add answer options by clicking :guilabel:`Add a line`, and typing in the
various answer options for that question. Then, either press :kbd:`Enter` to lock in that answer
option and immediately add another one. Or, click away to simply lock in that answer option.

The entered answer options appear in the :guilabel:`Choices` column of the :guilabel:`Answers` tab.

If any *Scoring* option is enabled in the :guilabel:`Options` tab of the survey form, the
:guilabel:`Correct` and :guilabel:`Score` columns appear to the right of the :guilabel:`Choices`
column.

To mark an answer option as correct, tick the box beneath the :guilabel:`Correct` column for the
respective question. If :guilabel:`Multiple choice: multiple answers allowed` is set as the
:guilabel:`Question Type`, multiple answers in the :guilabel:`Choices` column can be marked as
:guilabel:`Correct`.

In the :guilabel:`Score` column, designate how many points (if any) should be rewarded to the
participant for entering that specific answer. It is possible to enter a negative amount as the
:guilabel:`Score` to take points away for an incorrect response.

The option to upload a corresponding image to accompany the answer options is available on the
question line, beneath the :guilabel:`Image` column, by clicking :guilabel:`Upload your file`, and
uploading the desired image.

To delete any answer option, click the :guilabel:`🗑️ (trash can)` icon to the far-right of the
question line.

An exception to that is if the :guilabel:`Matrix` option is selected as the :guilabel:`Question
Type`. If that's chosen, the :guilabel:`Answers` tab remains, but below the typical
:guilabel:`Choices` section, there is a :guilabel:`Rows` section. That's because the
:guilabel:`Matrix` option provides an answer table for participants to fill out.

.. image:: questions/matrix-answer-tab.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The answer tab with a matrix question type selected in Odoo Surveys.

Description tab
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the :guilabel:`Description` tab of the :guilabel:`Create Sections and Questions` pop-up window is
used to provide any kind of guidelines, instructions, or any other type of supplemental material
deemed necessary to help participants answer/understand the question.

Entering a description is **not** required.

Options tab
~~~~~~~~~~~

In the :guilabel:`Options` tab of the :guilabel:`Create Sections and Questions` pop-up window, there
are four available sections: :guilabel:`Answers`, :guilabel:`Constraints`, :guilabel:`Conditional
Display`, and :guilabel:`Live Sessions`.

Answers section
***************

.. note::
   Fields in the :guilabel:`Answers` section in the :guilabel:`Options` tab of the :guilabel:`Create
   Sections and Questions` pop-up window vary, depending on the selected :guilabel:`Question Type`
   and overall :guilabel:`Options` configured on the survey form.

Multiple Choice question types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the selected :guilabel:`Question Type` is either :guilabel:`Multiple choice: only one answer` or
:guilabel:`Multiple choice: multiple answers allowed`, there is a :guilabel:`Show Comments Field`
present in the :guilabel:`Answers` section.

When enabled, two additional fields appear: :guilabel:`Comment Message` and :guilabel:`Comment is an

In the :guilabel:`Comment Message` field, type in a guiding message to help participants know what
is expected of them (e.g. `If other, please specify`).

If the :guilabel:`Comment is an answer` option is enabled, Odoo takes the participant's commented
response as an answer, and not just commentary on the question. This is best utilized in surveys
where there is no scoring option enabled.

Multiple Lines Text Box question type
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the selected :guilabel:`Question Type` is :guilabel:`Multiple Lines Text Box`, a
:guilabel:`Placeholder` field appears in the :guilabel:`Answers` section of the :guilabel:`Options`
tab.

.. image:: questions/multiple-lines-placeholder.png

In the :guilabel:`Placeholder` field, enter a guiding direction to help participants know what they
should write in the :guilabel:`Multiple Lines Text Box` presented to them.

Single Line Text Box, Numerical Value, Date, Datetime question types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the selected :guilabel:`Question Type` is :guilabel:`Single Line Text Box`, :guilabel:`Numerical
Value`, :guilabel:`Date`, or :guilabel:`Datetime`, two options appear in the :guilabel:`Answers`
section of the :guilabel:`Options` tab: :guilabel:`Validate Entry` and :guilabel:`Placeholder`.

If the :guilabel:`Validate Entry` option is enabled, two additional fields appear beneath:
:guilabel:`Min/Max Limits` and :guilabel:`Validation Error`.

.. image:: questions/single-line-validate-entry.png

In the :guilabel:`Min/Max Limits` field, designate the minimum and maximum allowed quantities for
that specific question.

In the :guilabel:`Validation Error` field, enter a custom message that Odoo displays when an answer
is not valid.

In the :guilabel:`Placeholder` field, enter a guiding direction to help participants know what they
should write in the :guilabel:`Multiple Lines Text Box` presented to them.

Constraints section
*******************

The :guilabel:`Constraints` section in the :guilabel:`Options` tab is the same, regardless of the
selected :guilabel:`Question Type`.

.. image:: questions/constraints-section.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The Constraints section in the options tab in Odoo Surveys.

In the :guilabel:`Constraints` section, there is one option available: :guilabel:`Mandatory Answer`.

When :guilabel:`Mandatory Answer` is enabled, that means that specific question requires an answer
from the participant before they can move on. Also, when :guilabel:`Mandatory Answer` is enabled,
that reveals an additional field: :guilabel:`Error Message`.

In the :guilabel:`Error Message` field, enter a custom error message prompting the participant to
provide an answer for this question.

Conditional Display section
***************************

:guilabel:`Conditional Display` means the question is **only** displayed if a specified conditional
answer(s) (i.e. :guilabel:`Triggering Answers`) has been selected in a previous question(s).

.. note::
   The :guilabel:`Conditional Display` section of the :guilabel:`Options` tab is **not** available
   when questions are randomly picked.

There is only one field in the :guilabel:`Conditional Display` section: :guilabel:`Triggering
Answers`.

.. image:: questions/conditional-display-section.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The Conditional Display section of the options tab in the Odoo Surveys application.

In the :guilabel:`Triggering Answers` field, select specific responses from previous questions that
would trigger this question. More than one answer can be selected. Leave the field empty if the
question should always be displayed.

Live Sessions section
*********************

The option in the :guilabel:`Live Sessions` section of the :guilabel:`Options` tab are **only**
supported by *Live Session* surveys.

There is only one option available in the :guilabel:`Live Sessions` section: :guilabel:`Question
Time Limit`.

.. image:: questions/live-sessions-section.png

When the :guilabel:`Question Time Limit` option is enabled, designate how much time (in
:guilabel:`seconds`) participants have to answer the question during a *Live Session* survey.

Scoring surveys
===============

To measure a survey participant's performance, knowledge, or overall satisfaction, Odoo assigns
points to survey answers. At the end of the survey, these points are summed up, resulting in the
participant's final score.

To add points to questions, open the :guilabel:`Surveys` application, choose the desired survey
form, and then click on the :guilabel:`Options` tab. Under the :guilabel:`Scoring` section, choose
between :guilabel:`Scoring with answers at the end` or :guilabel:`Scoring without answers at the
end`.

- :guilabel:`Scoring with answers at the end` shows the survey participant their answers after
  completing the survey, and displays which questions they got right or wrong. On questions where
  there was an incorrect answer, the correct answer will be highlighted.

- :guilabel:`Scoring without answers at the end` does not show the survey participant their answer
  choices after completing the survey, only their final score.

To indicate correct answers, click on the :guilabel:`Questions tab` and choose a question. In the
question form, check the :guilabel:`Is a correct answer` box for the choice that is the correct
answer and attach a score value.

Back on the :guilabel:`Options` tab of the survey, set the :guilabel:`Success %`. The percentage
entered determines what percentage of correct answers is needed to pass the survey.

Further on the :guilabel:`Options` tab of the survey, survey administrators can also choose to make
the survey a certification. A certification indicates that the survey asks questions to test the
participants' knowledge level on a subject.

When enabling the :guilabel:`Is a certification` option, choose a :guilabel:`Certification email
template`. The certification will automatically be emailed using this email template to users who
pass the survey with a final score that is greater than or equal to the set :guilabel:`Success %`.

In the :guilabel:`Candidates` section, participants can be required to log in to take the survey. If
the :guilabel:`Login Required` setting is enabled, two new options appear: the :guilabel:`Attempts
Limit` checkbox, which limits the number of times a participant can attempt the survey, and the
option to :guilabel:`Give Badge`, located beneath the :guilabel:`Certification` options in the
:guilabel:`Scoring` section.

Badges are displayed on the eLearning portion of a given user's portal, and are a way to set
milestones and reward participants for passing surveys or gaining points. Besides the awardee,
website visitors who access the :guilabel:`Courses` page will also be able to see the granted
badges.

By subscribing to the Odoo Enterprise services (the "Services") provided by Odoo SA and its
affiliates (collectively, "Odoo SA") in relation with Odoo Enterprise Edition or Odoo Community
Edition (the "Software"), hosted on Odoo SA's Cloud platforms (the "Cloud Platform") or
on-premises ("Self-Hosting"), you (the "Customer") are agreeing to be bound by the
following terms and conditions (the "Agreement").

.. _term:

1 Term of the Agreement
=======================

The duration of this Agreement (the “Term”) shall be specified in writing on conclusion of this
Agreement, beginning on the date of conclusion.
It is automatically renewed for an equal Term, unless either party provides a written notice of
termination minimum 30 days before the end of the Term to the other party.

.. _definitions:

2 Definitions
=============

User
    Any user account indicated as active in the Software, with access to creation and/or edition mode.
    Deactivated user accounts and accounts used by external people (or systems) who only have
    limited access to the Software through the portal facilities (known as "portal Users") are not
    counted as Users.

App
    An "App" is a specialized group of features available for installation in the Software.

Odoo Partner
    An Odoo Partner is a third-party company or individual, chosen by the Customer, and working
    with the Customer for their Odoo related services. The Customer can decide at any time to work
    with a different Odoo Partner, or to work with Odoo SA directly (subject to prior notice).

Extra Module
    An extra module is a directory of source code files, or a set of Python-based customizations
    created in a database (e.g. with Odoo Studio), that adds features or changes the standard
    behavior of the Software. It may have been developed by the Customer, by Odoo SA, by an Odoo
    Partner on behalf of the Customer, or by third parties.

Covered Extra Module
    A Covered Extra Module is an Extra Module for which the Customer chooses to pay a maintenance
    fee in order to get support, upgrade and bug fixing services.

Bug
    Is considered a Bug any failure of the Software or of a Covered Extra Module that results in
    a complete stop, error traceback or security breach, and is not directly caused by a defective
    installation or configuration.
    Non-compliance with specifications or requirements will be considered as Bugs at
    the discretion of Odoo SA (typically, when the Software does not produce the results or
    performance it was designed to produce, or when a country-specific feature does not meet legal
    accounting requirements anymore).

Covered Versions
    The 3 most recently released major versions of the Software. A new major version is released
    once per year.

Subscription Plan
    A Subscription Plan defines a set of Apps, features and hosting solutions covered by this
    Agreement, and is defined in writing at the conclusion of this Agreement.


.. _enterprise_access:

3 Access to the Software
========================

The Customer can use the Software hosted on the Cloud Platform, or choose the Self-Hosting option.
The Cloud Platform is hosted and fully managed by Odoo SA, and accessed remotely by the Customer.
With the Self-Hosting option, the Customer instead hosts the Software on computer systems of their
choice, that are not under the control of Odoo SA.

For the duration of this Agreement, Odoo SA gives the Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferable
license to use (execute, modify, execute after modification) the Odoo Enterprise Edition software,
under the terms set forth in :ref:`appendix_a`.

The Customer agrees to take all necessary measures to guarantee the unmodified execution of
the part of the Software that verifies the validity of the Odoo Enterprise Edition usage and
collects statistics for that purpose, including but not limited to the running of an instance,
the number of Users, the installed Apps, and the number of lines of code of Covered Extra Modules.

Odoo SA commits not to disclose individual or named figures to third parties without the consent
of the Customer, and to deal with all collected data in compliance with its official Privacy
Policy, published at https://www.odoo.com/privacy.

Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, this license is revoked immediately and the
Customer agrees to stop using the Odoo Enterprise Edition software and the Cloud Platform.

Should the Customer breach the terms of this section, the Customer agrees to pay Odoo SA an extra
fee equal to 300% of the applicable list price for the actual number of Users.


.. _services:

4 Services
==========

.. _bugfix:

4.1 Bug Fixing Service
----------------------

For the duration of this Agreement, Odoo SA commits to making all reasonable efforts to remedy any
Bug of the Software and Covered Extra Modules submitted by the Customer through the appropriate
channel (typically, the web form or phone numbers listed on `odoo.com/help <https://www.odoo.com/help>`_,
or when working with an Odoo Partner, the channel provided by the partner), and to start handling
such Customer submissions within 2 business days.

As soon as the Bug is fixed an appropriate remedy will be communicated to the Customer.
If the Customer is not using a Covered Version, they might be asked to upgrade to a more recent
Covered Version of the Software as a remedy to a Bug.

When a Bug is fixed in any Covered Version, Odoo SA commits to fixing the Bug in all more recent
Covered Versions of the Software.

Both parties acknowledge that as specified in the license of the Software and in the :ref:`liability`
section of this Agreement, Odoo SA cannot be held liable for Bugs in the Software
or in Covered Extra Modules.


4.2 Security Updates Service
----------------------------

.. _secu_self_hosting:

Self-Hosting
~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the duration of this Agreement, Odoo SA commits to sending a "Security Advisory" to the Customer
for any security Bug that is discovered in the Covered Versions of the Software (this excludes Extra
Modules), at least 2 weeks before making the Security Advisory public, unless the Bug has already
been disclosed publicly by a third party.
Security Advisories include a complete description of the Bug, its cause, its possible impacts
on the Customer's systems, and the corresponding remedy for each Covered Version.

The Customer understands that the Bug and the information in the Security Advisory must be treated
as Confidential Information as described in :ref:`confidentiality` during the embargo period prior to
the public disclosure.

.. _secu_cloud_platform:

Cloud Platform
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Odoo SA commits to apply the security remedies for any security Bug discovered in a version of
the Software hosted on the Cloud Platform, on all systems under its control, as soon as
the remedy is available, without requiring any manual action of the Customer.


.. _upgrade:

4.3 Upgrade Services
--------------------

.. _upgrade_odoo:

Upgrade Service for the Software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the duration of this Agreement, the Customer can submit upgrade requests through the appropriate
channel (typically Odoo SA's upgrade service website), in order to convert a database of the Software
from any version of the Software to a more recent Covered Version (the "Target Version").

For the Cloud Platform, upgrade requests are submitted directly from the control panel of the
Cloud Platform, and do not require any data upload. For Self-Hosting,
upgrade requests must include a copy of the Customer's database and the
associated data (typically obtained from the Backup menu of the Software).

This service provided through an automated platform in order to allow the Customer to perform
unattended upgrades once a previous version of the Customer's database has been successfully
upgraded for a Covered Version.

The Upgrade Service is limited to the technical conversion and adaptation of the Customer's database
to make it compatible with the Target Version, the correction of any Bug directly caused by the
upgrade operation and not normally occurring in the Target Version, and the conversion of the source
code and data of Covered Extra Modules for the Target Version.

It is the responsibility of the Customer to verify and validate the upgraded database in order
to detect Bugs, to analyze the impact of changes and new features implemented in the Target Version,
and to convert and adapt for the Target Version any third-party extensions of the Software that
were installed in the database before the upgrade (e.g. non-convered Extra Modules).
The Customer may submit multiple upgrade requests for a database, until an acceptable result is
achieved.

.. _cloud_hosting:

4.4 Cloud Hosting Services
--------------------------

For the duration of this Agreement, when the Customer chooses to use the Cloud Platform,
Odoo SA commits to providing at least the following services:

- Choice of multiple hosting regions (minimum 3: Europe, America, Asia/Pacific)
- Hosting in Tier-III data centers or equivalent, with 99.9% network uptime
- Grade A SSL (HTTPS) Encryption of communication
- Fully automated, verified backups, replicated in multiple regions
- Disaster Recovery Plan, tested regularly

The details of the Cloud Hosting Services are described on the Service Level Agreement page at
https://www.odoo.com/cloud-sla.


.. _support_service:

4.5 Support Services
--------------------

Scope
~~~~~

For the duration of this Agreement, the Customer may open an unlimited number of support tickets
free of charge, exclusively for questions regarding Bugs (see :ref:`bugfix`) or guidance
with respect to the use of the standard features of the Software and Covered Extra Modules.

Other assistance requests, such as questions related to development or customizations
may be covered through the purchase of a separate service agreement.
In case it’s not clear if a request is covered by this Agreement,
the decision is at the discretion of Odoo SA.

Availability
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tickets can be submitted via the web form or phone numbers listed on `odoo.com/help <https://www.odoo.com/help>`_,
or when working with an Odoo Partner, the channel provided by the partner, subject to local
opening hours.


.. _maintenance_partner:

4.6 Working with an Odoo Partner
--------------------------------

For bug fixes, support and upgrade services, the Customer may either work with an Odoo Partner
as the main point of contact, or work with Odoo SA directly.

If the Customer decides to work with an Odoo Partner, Odoo SA will subcontract services related
to the Covered Extra Modules to the Odoo Partner, who becomes the main point of contact of the
customer. The Odoo Partner may contact Odoo SA on behalf of the customer for second-level assistance
with regard to standard features of the Software.

If the Customer decides to work with Odoo SA directly, services related to Covered Extra Modules
are provided *if and only if* the Customer is hosted on the Odoo Cloud Platform.


.. _charges:

5 Charges and Fees
==================

.. _charges_standard:

5.1 Standard charges
--------------------

The standard charges for the Odoo Enterprise subscription and the Services are based on the number
of Users and the Subscription Plan used by the Customer, and specified in writing
at the conclusion of the Agreement.

When during the Term, the Customer has more Users or uses features that require another
Subscription Plan than specified at the time
of conclusion of this Agreement, the Customer agrees to pay an extra fee equivalent to the applicable
list price (at the time of the deviation from the specified number of Users or Subscription Plan)
for the additional Users or the required Subscription Plan, for the remainder of the Term.

.. Non-covered versions: according to FP, this extra fee will be computed taking into account all
   permanent changes to the per-user price, such as the Plan or any "light user discount".
   But the wording of the "current per-user price" is meant to exclude discounts related to the
   subscription period, such as first-year discount and multi-year discounts.
   This per-user price is annualized: for monthly subs it gets multiplied by 12, and for
   multi-year subs it's divided by the number of years.

Once per year, and no earlier than 6 months after the release of a new major version of the Software,
if the Customer’s database is on a version older than the Covered Versions, the Customer agrees
to pay an extra fee equal to 25% of the annualized price, calculated based on the Customer's
current per-user price and number of Users.

In addition, services for Covered Extra Modules are charged based on the number of lines of code
in these modules. When the Customer opts for the maintenance of Covered Extra Modules, the charge
is a monthly fee per 100 lines of code (rounded up to the next hundred), as
specified in writing at the conclusion of the Agreement. Lines of code will be counted with the ``cloc``
command of the Software, and include all text lines in the source code of those modules, regardless
of the programming language (Python, Javascript, XML, etc.), excluding blank lines, comment lines
and files that are not loaded when installing or executing the Software.

When the Customer requests an upgrade, for each Covered Extra Module that has not been covered by
a maintenance fee for the last 12 months, Odoo SA may charge a one-time extra fee
for each missing month of coverage.

.. _charges_renewal:

5.2 Renewal charges
-------------------

Upon renewal as covered in section :ref:`term`, if the charges applied during the previous Term
(excluding any extra fee for use of a non-Covered Version) are lower than the most current
applicable list price, these charges will increase by up to 7% per year of the previous Term.

.. _taxes:

5.3 Taxes
---------

.. FIXME : extra section, not sure we need it?

All fees and charges are exclusive of all applicable federal, provincial, state, local or other
governmental taxes, fees or charges (collectively, "Taxes"). The Customer is responsible for paying
all Taxes associated with purchases made by the Customer under this Agreement, except when Odoo SA
is legally obliged to pay or collect Taxes for which the Customer is responsible.


.. _conditions:

6 Conditions of Services

  upon request (e.g. if the automatic validation is found to be inoperant for the Customer).


.. _no_soliciting:

6.2 No Soliciting or Hiring
---------------------------

Except where the other party gives its consent in writing, each party, its affiliates and
representatives agree not to solicit or offer employment to any employee of the other party who is
involved in performing or using the Services under this Agreement, for the duration of the Agreement
and for a period of 12 months from the date of termination or expiration of this Agreement.
In case of any breach of the conditions of this section that leads to the termination of said

EUR (€) 30 000.00 (thirty thousand euros).


.. _publicity:

6.3 Publicity
-------------

Except where notified otherwise in writing, each party grants the other a non-transferable,

.. _confidentiality:

6.4 Confidentiality
-------------------

Definition of "Confidential Information":
    All information disclosed by a party (the "Disclosing Party") to the other party
    (the "Receiving Party"), whether orally or in writing, that is designated as confidential or
    that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and
    the circumstances of disclosure. In particular any information related to the business,
    affairs, products, developments, trade secrets, know-how, personnel, customers and suppliers of
    either party should be regarded as confidential.

For all Confidential Information received during the Term of this Agreement, the Receiving Party
will use the same degree of care that it uses to protect the confidentiality of its own similar
Confidential Information, but not less than reasonable care.

The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to the extent
compelled by law to do so, provided the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party prior notice of
the compelled disclosure, to the extent permitted by law.


.. _data_protection:

6.5 Data Protection
-------------------

Definitions
    "Personal Data", "Controller", "Processing" take the same meanings as in the
    Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and the Directive 2002/58/EC,
    and any regulation or legislation that amends or replaces them
    (hereafter referred to as “Data Protection Legislation”)

Processing of Personal Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The parties acknowledge that the Customer's database may contain Personal Data, for which the
Customer is the Controller. This data will be processed by Odoo SA when the Customer instructs so,
by using any of the Services that require a database (e.g. the Cloud Hosting Services or
the Database Upgrade Service), or if the Customer transfers their database or a part of
their database to Odoo SA for any reason pertaining to this Agreement.

This processing will be performed in conformance with Data Protection Legislation.
In particular, Odoo SA commits to:

- (a) only process the Personal Data when and as instructed by the Customer, and for the purpose of
  performing one of the Services under this Agreement, unless required by law to do so,
  in which case Odoo SA will provide prior notice to the Customer, unless the law
  forbids it ;
- (b) ensure that all persons within Odoo SA authorised to process the Personal Data have committed
  themselves to confidentiality ;
- (c) implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect
  the Personal Data against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss,
  destruction, damage, theft, alteration or disclosure ;
- (d) forward promptly to the Customer any Data Protection request that was submitted
  to Odoo SA with regard to the Customer's database ;
- (e) notify the Customer promptly upon becoming aware of and confirming any accidental,
  unauthorized, or unlawful processing of, disclosure of, or access to the Personal Data ;
- (f) notify the Customer if the processing instructions infringe applicable Data Protection
  Legislation, in the opinion of Odoo SA;
- (g) make available to the Customer all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the
  Data Protection Legislation, allow for and contribute reasonably to audits, including
  inspections, conducted or mandated by the Customer;
- (h) permanently delete all copies of the Customer's database in possession of Odoo SA,
  or return such data, at the Customer’s choice, upon termination of this Agreement,
  subject to the delays specified in Odoo SA's
  `Privacy Policy <https://www.odoo.com/privacy>`_ , unless Odoo SA is legally required
  to retain the data. In such cases, Odoo SA commits to process the personal data solely
  for the purposes and duration required by law.

With regard to points (d) to (f), the Customer agrees to provide Odoo SA with accurate contact
information at all times, as necessary to notify the Customer's Data Protection responsible.

Subprocessors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Customer acknowledges and agrees that in order to provide the Services, Odoo SA may use
third-party service providers (Subprocessors) to process Personal Data. Odoo SA commits to only
use Subprocessors in compliance with Data Protection Legislation. This use will be covered by a
contract between Odoo SA and the Subprocessor that provides guarantees to that effect.
Odoo SA's Privacy Policy, published at https://www.odoo.com/privacy provides up-to-date information
regarding the names and purposes of Subprocessors currently in use by Odoo SA for the
execution of the Services.

the applicable fees for the Services within 21 days following the due date specified on the
corresponding invoice, and after minimum 3 reminders.

To support that, PARTNER will market in priority the "Odoo Enterprise Edition" version to prospects
and customers. PARTNER still has the option to sell services on other versions of the software,
like "Odoo Community Edition", should it be needed.

2 Term of the Agreement
=======================
The duration of this Agreement (the “Term”) shall be one year beginning on the date of the signature.
It is automatically renewed for an equal Term unless either party provides written notice of
termination minimum 30 days before the end of the Term to the other party.


3 Access to Odoo Enterprise Edition
===================================

3.1 Project platform access
---------------------------
To help PARTNER promote Odoo Enterprise Edition, ODOO grants PARTNER access to its project code repository
for all "Odoo Enterprise Edition" Apps, under the terms set forth in :ref:`appendix_p_a`
and the conditions restricted under this Agreement.

In addition, ODOO grants PARTNER free access to the ODOO.SH platform for testing and development
purposes.

.. _restrictions:

3.2 Restrictions
----------------
PARTNER commits to keeping confidentiality of the source code of Odoo Enterprise Edition Apps
within its staff. Access to the source code of Odoo Enterprise Edition for customers is
governed by the Odoo Enterprise Subscription Agreement.
PARTNER agrees to NOT redistribute this code to third parties without the written permission of ODOO.

PARTNER commits to not offer services on Odoo Enterprise Edition to customers who are not covered
by an Odoo Enterprise subscription, even during the implementation phase.

Notwithstanding the above, PARTNER commits to wholly preserve the integrity of the
Odoo Enterprise Edition code that is required to verify the validity of usage of Odoo Enterprise
Edition and to collect statistics that are needed for that purpose.

PARTNER is not allowed to block, restrict or limit in any way the customer's access and use of
the Odoo Enterprise Edition License, without prior consultation and written authorisation from ODOO.


4 Partnership Services
======================

4.1 Partnership levels
----------------------
The Odoo partner program consists of two types of partnerships and four levels;
“Learning Partners” is for companies who want everything necessary to start implementing Odoo,
without visibility as an official partner until they get the required experience;
“Official Partners” is for companies who want the visibility as Ready, Silver, and Gold,
according to their experience with Odoo.

Partnership level granted to PARTNER depends on the *net new Odoo Enterprise users sold* in
the last 12 months, the number of certified resources and the customer
Retention Rate. The *net new Odoo Enterprise users sold* includes new customers, upsells on existing
customer, downsells on existing customers, and customer churn.
Renewals of existing contracts do not count towards the number of Users Sold, but PARTNER
still gets a commission on these contracts as stated in section :ref:`benefits`.

The table below summarizes the requirements that have to be met for each partnership level.

The customer *Retention Rate* is calculated by dividing the total number of Odoo Enterprise customers
acquired by PARTNER in the last 3 years that are currently active by the total number of Odoo Enterprise
customers acquired by PARTNER in the last 3 years.

+--------------------------------------------+------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+
|                                            | Learning Partner | Official: Ready    | Official: Silver   | Official: Gold     |

| one of the 3 last Odoo versions            |                  |                    |                    |                    |
+--------------------------------------------+------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+
| Minimum Retention Rate                     |   n/a            |  n/a               | 70%                |  80%               |
+--------------------------------------------+------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+

Certifications are personal, so when a certified staff member leaves or joins the company,
PARTNER must notify ODOO.

PARTNER's partnership level will be reviewed quarterly by ODOO, and adjusted
to the highest level for which the 3 requirements are met.

However, "Official Partners" may be upgraded automatically to a higher level once they reach the
3 requirements for that higher partnership level.

connected events causing damages the total amount for the fees paid by PARTNER in the course of the
six (6) months immediately preceding the date of the event giving rise to such claim.

General Terms of Sale
=====================

   `Download PDF <https://www.odoo.com/documentation/{CURRENT_BRANCH}/terms_of_sale.pdf>`_

.. note:: Last revision: September 12, 2023.

These General Terms of Sale govern the sale of products and services by
Odoo S.A. and its affiliates (collectively, "Odoo S.A.") to the client.
Additional terms may apply for services provided by Odoo S.A. (for example, the
Enterprise Subscription Agreement). If these additional terms are inconsistent
with the General Terms of Sale, the additional terms will prevail over these
General Terms of Sale.

Please read these terms carefully before placing an order with Odoo S.A. By
accepting an order with Odoo S.A., the client marks his acceptance with these
terms.

The client explicitly waives its own standard terms and conditions, even if
these were drawn up after these standard terms and conditions of sale. In
order to be valid, any derogation must be expressly agreed to in advance in
writing.

Our invoices are payable within 21 working days, unless another payment
timeframe is indicated on either the invoice or the order. In the event of
non-payment by the due date, Odoo S.A. reserves the right to request a fixed
interest payment amounting to 15% of the sum remaining due. Odoo S.A. will be
authorised to suspend any provision of services without prior warning in the
event of late payment.

If a payment is still outstanding more than sixty (60) days after the due
payment date, Odoo S.A. reserves the right to call on the services of a debt
recovery company. All legal expenses will be payable by the client.

Certain countries apply withholding at source on the amount of invoices, in
accordance with their internal legislation. Any withholding at source will be
paid by the client to the tax authorities. Under no circumstances can Odoo S.A.
become involved in costs related to a country's legislation. The amount of the
invoice will therefore be due to Odoo S.A. in its entirety and does not include
any costs relating to the legislation of the country in which the client is
located.

For clients with a global presence, the applicable pricing is always
based on the client location with the highest price list, unless otherwise
specified in writing at the time of purchase.

Monthly Subscriptions are only available for hosting on the Cloud Platform
(Odoo SaaS and Odoo SH). Payment of Monthly Subscriptions can only be made
by credit card or an equivalent supported automatic debit method. Odoo S.A.
reserves the right to refuse any Monthly Subscription that does not comply
with these conditions.

Odoo S.A. undertakes to do its best to supply services in due time in accordance
with the agreed timeframes. However, none of its obligations can be considered
as being an obligation to achieve results. Odoo S.A. cannot, under any
circumstances, be required by the client to appear as a third party in the
context of any claim for damages filed against the client by an end consumer.

In order for it to be admissible, Odoo S.A. must be notified of any claim by
means of a letter sent by recorded delivery to its registered office within 8
days of the delivery of the goods or the provision of the services.

To the maximum extent permitted by law, the aggregate liability of each party
together with its affiliates arising will not exceed 50% of the total amount
paid by the Customer under these terms during the 12 months immediately
preceding the date of the event giving rise to such claim. Multiple claims shall
not enlarge this limitation.

Odoo S.A. reserves the right to modify these terms at any time without prior
notice. The client will be subject to the terms in force at the time of
acceptation of those terms.

All our contractual relations will be governed exclusively by Belgian law.
Moreover, any dispute that may arise will be subject exclusively to the
jurisdiction of the courts of the Nivelles arrondissement (Belgium).

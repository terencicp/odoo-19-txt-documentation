Database management
===================

These guides provide instructions on how to install, maintain and upgrade Odoo databases.

.. seealso::
    :doc:`History of Versions <administration/standard_extended_support>`

Installation
============

Depending on the intended use case, there are multiple ways to install Odoo - or not install it at
all.

- :doc:`Online <administration/odoo_online>` is the easiest way to use Odoo in production or to try it.

- :doc:`Packaged installers <administration/on_premise/packages>` are suitable for testing Odoo and
  developing modules. They can be used for long-term production with additional deployment and
  maintenance work.

- :doc:`Source install <administration/on_premise/source>` provides greater flexibility, as it
  allows, for example, running multiple Odoo versions on the same system. It is adequate to develop
  modules and can be used as a base for production deployment.

- A `Docker <https://hub.docker.com/_/odoo/>`_ base image is available for development or
  deployment.

.. _install/editions:

Editions
========

There are two different editions.

**Odoo Community** is the free and open-source version of the software, licensed under the `GNU
LGPLv3 <https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/master/LICENSE>`_. It is the core upon which Odoo
Enterprise is built.

**Odoo Enterprise** is the shared source version of the software, giving access to more
functionalities, including functional support, upgrades, and hosting. `Pricing
<https://www.odoo.com/pricing-plan>`_ starts from one app free.

.. tip::
   :doc:`Switch from Community to Enterprise <administration/on_premise/community_to_enterprise>` at
   any time (except for the source install).

.. _hosting/change-solution:

Change hosting solution
=======================

The instructions to change the hosting type of a database depend on the current solution used and to
which solution the database should be moved.

Transferring an on-premise database
===================================

To Odoo Online
--------------

.. important::
   - Odoo Online is *not* compatible with **non-standard apps**.
   - The database's current version must be :doc:`supported <standard_extended_support>`.

#. Create a :ref:`duplicate of the database <on-premise/duplicate>`.
#. In this duplicate, uninstall all **non-standard apps**.
#. Use the database manager to grab a *dump with filestore*.
#. `Create a support ticket <https://www.odoo.com/help-form>`_ including the following:

   - your **subscription number**,
   - the **URL** you want to use for the database (e.g., `company.odoo.com`), and
   - the **dump** as an attachment or as a link to the file (required for 60 MB+ files).

#. Odoo then makes sure the database is compatible before putting it online. In case of technical
   issues during the process, Odoo might contact you.

.. note::
   If you have time constraints, `create a support ticket <https://www.odoo.com/help-form>`_ as soon
   as possible to schedule the transfer.

To Odoo.sh
----------

Follow the instructions found in :ref:`the Import a database section <odoo-sh/create/import>` of the
Odoo.sh *Create a project* documentation.

Transferring an Odoo Online database
====================================

.. important::
   Odoo Online's :doc:`intermediary versions <standard_extended_support>` are not supported by
   Odoo.sh or on-premise. Therefore, if the database to transfer is running an intermediary version,
   it must be upgraded first to the next :doc:`major version <standard_extended_support>`, waiting
   for its release if necessary.

   .. example::
      Transferring an online database running on Odoo 16.3 would require first upgrading it to Odoo
      17.0.

   .. tip::
      Click the :icon:`fa-gear` (:guilabel:`gear`) button next to the database name on the `Odoo
      Online database manager <https://www.odoo.com/my/databases/>`_ to display its version number.

   .. warning::
      If there is an active Odoo subscription linked to the database being migrated, reach out to
      the Customer Service Manager or `contact Odoo support <https://www.odoo.com/help>`_ to
      complete the subscription transfer.

To on-premise
-------------

#. Download a database backup by signing in to `the Odoo Online database manager
   <https://www.odoo.com/my/databases/>`_, clicking the :icon:`fa-gear` (:guilabel:`gear`) button
   next to the database name, then selecting :icon:`fa-cloud-download` :guilabel:`Download`. If the
   download fails due to the file being too large, `contact Odoo support
   <https://www.odoo.com/help>`_.
#. Restore the database from the database manager on your local server using the backup.

To Odoo.sh
----------

#. Download a database backup by signing in to `the Odoo Online database manager
   <https://www.odoo.com/my/databases/>`_, clicking the :icon:`fa-gear` (:guilabel:`gear`) button
   next to the database name, then selecting :icon:`fa-cloud-download` :guilabel:`Download`. If the
   download fails due to the file being too large, `contact Odoo support
   <https://www.odoo.com/help>`_.
#. Follow the instructions found in :ref:`the Import a database section <odoo-sh/create/import>` of
   the Odoo.sh *Create a project* documentation.

Transferring an Odoo.sh database
================================

To Odoo Online
--------------

.. important::
   Odoo Online is *not* compatible with **non-standard apps**.

#. Uninstall all **non-standard apps** in a staging build before doing it in the production build.
#. `Create a support ticket <https://www.odoo.com/help-form>`_ including the following:

   - your **subscription number**,
   - the **URL** you want to use for the database (e.g., `company.odoo.com`),
   - which **branch** should be migrated,
   - in which **region** you want the database to be hosted (Americas, Europe, or Asia),
   - which user(s) will be the **administrator(s)**, and
   - **when** (and in which timezone) you want the database to be up and running.

#. Odoo then makes sure the database is compatible before putting it online. In case of technical
   issues during the process, Odoo might contact you.

.. note::
   - If you have time constraints, `create a support ticket <https://www.odoo.com/help-form>`_ as
     soon as possible to schedule the transfer.
   - Select the **region** closest to most of your users to reduce latency.
   - Future **administrator(s)** must have an Odoo.com account.
   - The **date and time** you want the database to be up and running are helpful to organize the
     switch from the Odoo.sh server to the Odoo Online servers.
   - Databases are **not reachable** during their migration.

To on-premise
-------------

#. Download a :ref:`backup of your Odoo.sh production database <odoo-sh/branches/tabs/backups>`.
#. Restore the database from the database manager on your local server using the backup.

Odoo mobile apps
================

Two kind of Odoo mobile app exist: the progressive web app (PWA) and store apps. Using the PWA is
recommended.

Progressive web app (PWA)
=========================

PWAs are web-based applications designed to function across different devices and platforms,
leveraging web browsers to deliver user experiences similar to native apps.

The Odoo PWA features include:

- Quick access by adding the PWA to a device's home screen
- Seamless and borderless navigation experience
- Push notifications
- SSO authentication

To install the Odoo PWA, launch a browser supporting PWAs, and sign in to an Odoo database. The
instructions to install a PWA depend on the platform and browser used.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Android

      **Chrome**: open Chrome's menu (:guilabel:`⋮`), select :guilabel:`Install app`, and tap
      :guilabel:`Install`.

      **Firefox**: open Firefox's menu (:guilabel:`⋮`), select :guilabel:`Install`, and either touch
      and hold the Odoo icon or tap :guilabel:`Add automatically`.

      The PWA can also be installed with **Samsung Internet**, **Edge**, and **Opera**.

   .. tab:: iOS

      **Safari**: open the **Share** menu by tapping the square with an arrow pointing upwards icon,
      select :guilabel:`Add to Home Screen`, edit the PWA details if desired, and tap
      :guilabel:`Add`.

      On iOS 16.4 and above, the PWA can also be installed with **Chrome**, **Firefox**, and
      **Edge**.

   .. tab:: Desktop

      **Chrome** and **Edge**: click the installation icon at the right of the address bar and click
      :guilabel:`Install`.

.. seealso::
   - `Google Chrome Help: Use progressive web apps
     <https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9658361>`_
   - `MDN Web Docs: Installing and uninstalling web apps
     <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Guides/Installing>`_
   - `Microsoft Support: Install, manage, or uninstall apps in Microsoft Edge <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/install-manage-or-uninstall-apps-in-microsoft-edge-0c156575-a94a-45e4-a54f-3a84846f6113>`_

Store apps
==========

The Odoo mobile apps are available for download on the `Google Play Store
<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.odoo.mobile>`_ and `Apple App Store
<https://apps.apple.com/app/odoo/id1272543640>`_.

.. important::
   The iOS app might not be updated and might be deprecated at some point in the future.

While the store apps support multi-accounts, they are not compatible with SSO authentication.


==================================================
SECTION: neutralized_database.rst
PATH: administration/neutralized_database.rst
==================================================

====================
Neutralized database
====================

A neutralized database is a non-production database on which several parameters are deactivated.
This enables one to carry out tests without the risk of launching specific automated processes that
could impact production data (e.g., sending emails to customers). Live access is removed and
turned into a testing environment.

.. note::
   **Any testing database created is a neutralized database:**

   - testing backup databases
   - duplicate databases
   - for Odoo.sh: staging and development databases

.. important::
   A database can also be neutralized when upgrading, as it is vital to do some tests before
   switching to a new version.

Deactivated features
====================

Here is a non-exhaustive list of the deactivated features:

- all planned actions (e.g., automatic invoicing of subscriptions, mass mailing, etc.)
- outgoing emails
- bank synchronization
- payment providers
- delivery methods
- :abbr:`IAP (In-App Purchase)` tokens
- website visibility (prevent search engines from indexing your site)

.. note::
   **A red banner at the top of the screen is displayed on the neutralized database so that it can
   be seen immediately.**

Standard and extended support
=============================

.. warning::
   The information presented on this page is not intended to amend, modify, or replace any terms of
   the :doc:`Odoo Enterprise Subscription Agreement <../legal/terms/enterprise>`. In the event of
   any inconsistency or conflict, the Subscription Agreement shall govern.

Odoo provides **standard support** for all major versions for three years. It includes helpdesk
support, bug fixing, and security updates.

Beyond those three years, you can benefit from **extended support** by paying an extra fee. It
includes helpdesk support and bug fixes (depending on feasibility).

.. note::
   - Odoo releases intermediary versions, called online or SaaS versions, every two to three months.
     These versions are only available on Odoo Online and are not eligible for extended support.
   - You can `upgrade <https://upgrade.odoo.com>`_ from any version.

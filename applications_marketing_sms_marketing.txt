Create SMS messages
===================

To start, click :guilabel:`Create` on the main :guilabel:`SMS Marketing` dashboard, and Odoo reveals
a blank SMS template form, which can be configured in a number of different ways.

.. image:: create_sms/sms-create.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Creating an SMS marketing template.

First, give the mailing a :guilabel:`Subject`, which describes what the mailing is about.

Next, in the :guilabel:`Recipients` field, choose to whom this :abbr:`SMS (Short Message Service)`
will be sent. By default, Odoo has :guilabel:`Mailing List` selected. If this is the desired
:guilabel:`Recipients` field option, specify which mailing list Odoo should send this :abbr:`SMS
(Short Message Service)` to in the :guilabel:`Select Mailing List` field.

.. note::
   To create (or edit) a mailing list, go to :menuselection:`Mailing Lists --> Mailing List`. There,
   Odoo displays all previously created mailing lists, along with various types of data related to
   that specific list (e.g. number of contacts, mailings, recipients, etc.).

   To learn more about mailing lists and contacts, check out :doc:`mailing_lists_blacklists`.

.. image:: create_sms/sms-mailing-list.png
   :align: center
   :alt: View of the mailing list page in the SMS marketing application.

To reveal all the possible options in the :guilabel:`Recipients` field, click the field to see all
the choices Odoo makes available.

When another field (other than :guilabel:`Mailing List`) is selected, the option to specify that
chosen field even further becomes available — either with a default recipient filter equation that
appears automatically (which can be customized to fit any business need), or, if no default
recipient filter equation is present, an :guilabel:`Add Filter` button will appear.

Clicking the :guilabel:`Add Filter` button, reveals fully customizable domain rule fields, which can
be configured similar to an equation. You can create multiple recipient rules, if necessary.

Then, Odoo will only send the :abbr:`SMS (Short Message Service)` to recipients who fit into
whatever criteria is configured in those fields. Multiple rules can be added.

.. example::
   If :guilabel:`Contact` is chosen, all of the *Contacts* records in the Odoo database (vendors,
   customers, etc.) will receive the :abbr:`SMS (Short Message Service)`, by default — unless more
   specific recipient rules are entered.

   For instance, the message below will only be sent to contacts in the database that are located in
   the United States (e.g. `Country` > `Country Name` equals `United States`), and they haven't
   blacklisted themselves from any mailings (e.g. `Blacklist` > `is` > `not set`).

   .. image:: create_sms/contact-recipient.png
      :align: center
      :alt: Contact recipients on SMS marketing.

Writing SMS messages
--------------------

Enter the content of the :abbr:`SMS (Short Message Service)` in the text field, found in the
:guilabel:`SMS Content` tab. Links and emojis can also be included. Beneath the text field, Odoo
displays how many characters are used in the message, along with how many :abbr:`SMS (Short Message
Service)` mailings it will take to deliver the complete message.

.. tip::
   To check the price of sending an :abbr:`SMS (Short Message Service)` for a country, click on the
   :guilabel:`Information` icon.

.. image:: create_sms/sms-price-check.png
   :align: center
   :alt: SMS price check icon.

.. note::
   Credits must be purchased from Odoo in order to take advantage of the *SMS Marketing* app;
   :abbr:`SMS (Short Message Service)` messages will not be sent without credits.

   `Odoo SMS - FAQ <https://iap-services.odoo.com/iap/sms/pricing>`_

Track links used in SMS messages
--------------------------------

When links are used in :abbr:`SMS (Short Message Service)` messages, Odoo automatically generates
link trackers to gather analytical data and metrics related to those specific links, which can be
found by going to :menuselection:`Configuration --> Link Tracker`.

.. image:: create_sms/sms-link-tracker.png
   :align: center
   :alt: SMS Link Tracker page.

Adjust SMS settings
===================

Under the :guilabel:`Settings` tab of the SMS template, there is an option to :guilabel:`Include
opt-out link`. If activated, the recipient is able to unsubscribe from the mailing list, thus
avoiding all future mailings.

An employee can be designated as the :guilabel:`Responsible` in the :guilabel:`Tracking` section of
the :guilabel:`Settings` tab, as well.

.. image:: create_sms/sms-settings-tab.png
   :align: center
   :alt: SMS Settings tab.

Send SMS messages
=================

Once a mailing is created, choose when Odoo should deliver the message from the following options:

- :guilabel:`Send`: sends the message immediately. Consider using this option if the recipient list
  is highly refined, or in cases that involve fast approaching deadlines, such as a "flash sale."
- :guilabel:`Schedule`: choose a day (and time) for Odoo to send the mailing. This is typically the
  best option for mailings related to a specific event. Such a method can also be used to promote a
  limited-time offer, or to help plan a company's content strategy in advance.
- :guilabel:`Test`: allows for an :abbr:`SMS (Short Message Service)` to be sent to one or multiple
  numbers for test purposes. Remember to use a comma between phone numbers if multiple numbers are
  used as recipients.

PATH: applications/marketing/sms_marketing/mailing_lists_blacklists.rst
==================================================

============================
Mailing lists and blacklists
============================

Creating or importing mailing lists in Odoo is very useful when curating content to specific groups
of people that already share similar demographics or interests. Mailing lists are also a great way
to get started if a company is migrating from another system, and already has a established
audience.

Moreover, providing an audience with the option to 'unsubscribe' from mailings, helps businesses
maintain good customer relations, by giving recipients the power to control what they are (and
aren't) sent.

Mailing lists
=============

In the :guilabel:`SMS Marketing` app, there's an option on the header menu called :guilabel:`Mailing
Lists`. When clicked, a sub-menu is revealed with options for :guilabel:`Mailing Lists` and
:guilabel:`Mailing List Contacts`.

Click :menuselection:`Mailing Lists --> Mailing Lists` to see an overview of all mailing lists in
the database.

.. image:: mailing_lists_blacklists/mailing-list-main-page.png
   :align: center
   :alt: View of the main SMS mailing list page on the Odoo SMS Marketing application.

To edit any existing list, select the desired list from the :guilabel:`Mailing Lists` page, and
proceed to modify it in a number of ways.

To create a new mailing list, click :guilabel:`Create` in the upper left corner of the
:guilabel:`Mailing Lists` page. Doing so, will reveal a blank mailing list template form.

.. image:: mailing_lists_blacklists/sms-mailing-list-popup.png
   :align: center
   :alt: View of the mailing list pop-up window in Odoo SMS Marketing.

First, choose a name for the :guilabel:`Mailing List`, and activate the option :guilabel:`Is
Public`, to make the mailing list accessible to recipients on the :guilabel:`Subscription Management
page`. Doing so allows users to update their subscription preferences at any time.

.. note::
   Checking the :guilabel:`Is Public` box is not required, but is recommended to maintain good
   customer relations.

When those fields are filled in, click :guilabel:`Create` to finalize the form. Then on the main
:guilabel:`Mailing Lists` dashboard, the new mailing list that was just created will be accessible.

To edit or customize the mailing list further, select the mailing list from the main
:guilabel:`Mailing Lists` page to reveal the mailing list detail form.

Along the top of the mailing list detail form, there are various analytical smart buttons displaying
statistics for different metrics related to the mailing list (e.g. :guilabel:`Recipients`,
:guilabel:`Mailings`, etc.).

To review or edit any of those elements, click the desired smart button to reveal a separate page
with in-depth data associated with the mailing list.

To make changes to the mailing list itself, click the :guilabel:`Edit` button in the upper-left
corner of the mailing list detail form.

.. image:: mailing_lists_blacklists/sms-mailing-list.png
   :align: center
   :alt: View of the mailing list template form in Odoo SMS Marketing.

.. note::
   Don't forget to hit the :guilabel:`Save` button once changes have been made.

Mailing lists contacts
======================

Access contacts information from one or more mailing lists navigate to :menuselection:`Mailing Lists
--> Mailing List Contacts` to reveal a dashboard with with all the contacts associated with one or
more of the configured mailing lists in the database.

.. image:: mailing_lists_blacklists/mailing-list-contacts-page.png
   :align: center
   :alt: View of the mailing lists contact page in the Odoo SMS Marketing application.

.. note::
   By default, Odoo reveals the :guilabel:`Mailing List Contacts` page with the :guilabel:`Exclude
   Blacklisted Phone` filter in the search bar. Therefore only showing contact information for
   recipients who still want to receive communications and mailings.

Communication history in the Chatter
------------------------------------

An accessible record of every sent mailing(s) is kept on each recipient's *chatter* section, located
beneath a recipient's contact form (in the *Contacts* application).

Database users can reference the chatter to easily keep track of communications, and see a history
of interactions with contacts and prospects.

For example, sales representatives can use the chatter to quickly find out which :abbr:`SMS (Short
Message Service)` mailing promotions a certain customer has received (or not received).

.. image:: mailing_lists_blacklists/sms-marketing-chatter.png
   :align: center
   :alt: View of what the chatter looks like in the Odoo Contacts app.

Blacklist
=========

Odoo *SMS Marketing* has a :guilabel:`Blacklist` feature that provides recipients with the power to
add their phone number to a list of people who no longer want to receieve communications or
mailings.

This is also known as the unsubscribe process: customers will automatically be added onto a
*blacklist*, if they click :guilabel:`Unsubscribe`, via their :guilabel:`Subscription Management`
page. Customers can also be added manually to the blacklist, if necessary.

To see a complete collection of blacklisted numbers, navigate to the :menuselection:`SMS Marketing
app --> Configuration --> Blacklisted Phone Numbers` to reveal a dashboard containing every
blacklisted phone number in the database.

.. image:: mailing_lists_blacklists/sms-blacklist-menu.png
   :align: center
   :alt: SMS Blacklist menu in the application.

To manually add a number to a blacklist, click the :guilabel:`Create` button in the upper-left
corner of the dashboard and enter the phone number on the next page's form. There's also a
checkbox to indicate whether that particular phone numnber is :guilabel:`Active` (or not).

.. image:: mailing_lists_blacklists/sms-blacklist-create.png
   :align: center
   :alt: SMS Blacklist menu in the application.

Once the form is completed, click :guilabel:`Save` to add it to the :guilabel:`Blacklisted Phone
Numbers` list. To remove any number from the blacklist, select the desired number on the dashboard,
and then, on the phone number's form, click :guilabel:`Unblacklist`.

Importing blacklists
--------------------

During a software/platform migration, it is possible to import an already existing blacklist of
contacts. This would include customers, who have already asked to be blacklisted` on :abbr:`SMS
(Short Message Service)` mailings.

To do that, navigate to :menuselection:`SMS Marketing app --> Configuration --> Blacklisted Phone
Numbers`, and then select the :guilabel:`Favorites` drop-down menu (beneath the search bar), and
click :guilabel:`Import records`.

SMS campaign settings
=====================

Utilizing :abbr:`SMS (Short Message Service)` campaigns with Odoo *SMS Marketing* isn't just an
effective advertisement strategy, it's also a great way to remind people about upcoming events,
issued invoices, and so much more.

But, before :abbr:`SMS (Short Message Service)` campaigns can be created (and sent), a few specific
settings and features must be enabled first.

SMS campaign setting
====================

To enable :abbr:`SMS (Short Message Service)` campaigns in Odoo, make sure the *Mailing Campaigns*
feature is activated by going to :menuselection:`Email Marketing --> Configuration --> Settings`,
and then enable :guilabel:`Mailing Campaigns` and :guilabel:`Save` the changes.

.. image:: marketing_campaigns/sms-mailing-campaigns.png
   :align: center
   :alt: View of the mailing campaigns setting in Odoo.

.. note::
   Activating the *Mailing Campaigns* feature in the *General Settings* also enables the *A/B Test*
   feature.

Once the setting is enabled, navigate back to the :menuselection:`SMS Marketing` app, and notice the
:guilabel:`Campaigns` header menu is now available for use. Similarly, the :guilabel:`A/B Test` tab
is now also available on every :abbr:`SMS (Short Message Service)` template form.

A/B tests
=========

:guilabel:`A/B Tests` allows any :abbr:`SMS (Short Message Service)` mailings to be tested against
other versions within the same campaign, in order to compare which version is the most successful in
producing engagement and/or conversion outcomes.

On an :abbr:`SMS (Short Message Service)` template form, under the :guilabel:`A/B Tests` tab,
initially, there's only a single checkbox labeled: :guilabel:`Allow A/B Testing.`

When clicked, a series of other options appear.

.. image:: marketing_campaigns/ab-tests-sms.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The A/B Test tab is located on an Odoo SMS Marketing app campaign form.

In the first field, enter a desired percentage of recipients to conduct the A/B Test on.

Beneath the percentage field is the :guilabel:`Winner Selection` field. This is what Odoo will use
to determine the successful result of an A/B Test. In other words, this tells Odoo how to pick a
winning A/B test.

The following sections are available: :guilabel:`Manual`, :guilabel:`Highest Click Rate`,
:guilabel:`Leads`, :guilabel:`Quotations`, or :guilabel:`Revenues`.

Finally, the :guilabel:`Send Final On` field is listed. This represents the date-time that Odoo uses
as a deadline to determine the winning mailing variation. Then, Odoo sends that winning mailing
variation to the remaining recipients, who weren't involved in the test, at that prior date and
time.

.. tip::
   Quickly create different versions of the mailing to add to the A/B Test by clicking the
   :guilabel:`Create an Alternate Version` button.

.. note::
   Remember, the winning mailing variation is based on the criteria selected in the
   :guilabel:`Winner Selection` field.

Campaigns page
==============

To create, edit, or analyze any campaign, click :menuselection:`Campaigns` in the header menu of the
:guilabel:`SMS Marketing` app. On the :guilabel:`Campaigns` page, each campaign displays various
information related to the mailings associated with that campaign (e.g. number of emails, social
posts, SMSs, and push notifications).

.. image:: marketing_campaigns/campaigns-page.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Dasbhoard view of different Campaigns in the Odoo SMS Marketing app, separated by stage.

Campaign templates
==================

Click :guilabel:`Create` to create a new campaign, and Odoo reveals a blank campaign template form
to fill out. Alternatively, select any previously-made campaign in order to duplicate, review, or
edit its campaign template form.

.. image:: marketing_campaigns/sms-campaign-template.png
   :align: center
   :alt: View of an SMS campaign template in Odoo SMS marketing.

With each campaign, the options to :guilabel:`Send New Mailing`, :guilabel:`Send SMS`,
:guilabel:`Send Social Post`, and :guilabel:`Push Notifications` are available above the template
form.

Whenever one of those communication options is added to the campaign, Odoo will create a new
corresponding tab on the template form, where those types of messages can be reviewed or edited,
along with various data sets related to each specific mailing.

At the top of the template, there are various analytical smart buttons. When clicked, Odoo reveals
in-depth metrics related to that specific topic (e.g. :guilabel:`Engagement`,
:guilabel:`Opportunities`, etc.) on a separate page.

Beneath the smart buttons, are fields for :guilabel:`Campaign Name` and :guilabel:`Responsible`.
Odoo also allows for various :guilabel:`Tags` to be added, as well (if necessary).

Sending SMSs through the Contacts app
=====================================

Sending :abbr:`SMS (Short Message Service)` mailings directly through a contact's form is available
by default.

In order to send an :abbr:`SMS (Short Message Service)` in this fashion, navigate to the
:menuselection:`Contacts` app, select the desired contact in the database, and click on the
:guilabel:`SMS` icon on the contact form (next to the :guilabel:`Phone Number` field).

.. image:: marketing_campaigns/sms-contact-form.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The SMS icon is located on an individual's contact form in Odoo Contacts.

To send a message to multiple contacts at once, navigate to the main :menuselection:`Contacts` app
main dashboard, choose the :guilabel:`List View`, and select all the desired contacts to whom the
message should be sent. Then, under :guilabel:`Action`, select :guilabel:`Send SMS`.

.. image:: marketing_campaigns/sms-contacts-action-send-message.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Select a number of contacts, click action, and select send multiple SMSs.

Set up SMS templates for future use
===================================

In order to set up :guilabel:`SMS Templates` for future use, activate :ref:`developer mode
<developer-mode>`, by navigating to the main Odoo dashboard that is full of apps, and select the
:menuselection:`Settings app`. Then, scroll down to the :guilabel:`Developer Tools` section, and
click :guilabel:`Activate the Developer Mode`.

Once *developer mode* is activated, the main Odoo dashboard appears once more, with a now-visible
bug icon, which is located at the top-right corner of the dashboard; this bug icon indicates that
developer mode is currently active.

Next return to the :menuselection:`Settings app` and, in the now-visible header menus at the top,
choose :menuselection:`Technical --> SMS Templates` to begin setting up :abbr:`SMS (Short Message
Service)` templates for future marketing campaigns.

.. image:: marketing_campaigns/sms-template-setting.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Select the SMS Template option in the Technical dropdown on the Settings app.

Inside of the :guilabel:`SMS Templates` dashboard, Odoo reveals an entire page of :abbr:`SMS (Short
Message Service)` templates. The default :guilabel:`List` view showcases each template's name, and
to which recipients it applies.

On this page, :abbr:`SMS (Short Message Service)` templates can be edited or created from scratch.

SMS Pricing and FAQ
===================

What do I need to send SMSs?
============================

SMS Text Messaging is an In-App Purchase (IAP) service that *requires prepaid credits* to work.

How many types of SMSs are there?
=================================

There are 2 types: GSM7 and UNICODE.

**GSM7** is the standard format, with a limit of 160 characters per message, that includes the
following characters:

.. image:: pricing_and_faq/faq1.png
   :align: center
   :alt: GSM7 characters available in Odoo SMS Marketing.

**UNICODE** is the format applied if a special character, that *is not* in the GSM7 list, is used.
Limit per SMS: 70 characters.

.. note::
   For GSM7 SMS the size limit is 160 characters, and for Unicode is 70. *Above these limits, the
   content is divided into a multi-part message* and the limit of characters is lowered to 153 for
   GSM7 and to 67 for Unicode. Then, in real-time, the system displays the number of SMS mailings
   the message represents.

How much does it cost to send an SMS?
=====================================

The price of an SMS depends on the destination and the length (number of characters) of the
message. To see the **price per country, please consult**: `Odoo SMS - FAQ
<https://iap-services.odoo.com/iap/sms/pricing#sms_faq_01>`_.

The number of SMSs a message represents will always be available in the database.

More common questions
=====================

#. | **Is there an expiration time for my credits?**
   | No, credits do not expire.

#. | **Can I send an SMS to a phone number (which is not a mobile phone) because I see the icon in
     front of the field “phone”?**
   | Only if that phone number supports SMS (e.g. SIP phones).

#. | **Do I receive an invoice to buy my credits?**
   | Yes.

#. | **Can the recipient answer me?**
   | No, it is not possible to reply to the SMS.

#. | **What happens if I send multiple SMSs at once, but I don't have enough credits to send them
     all?**
   | Multiple SMS communications at once at are counted as a single transaction, so no SMSs will be
     sent until there are enough credits to send them all.

#. | **Do I have a history of the sent SMSs?**
   | A history of sent SMSs, along with all pertinent information related to its sent contacts (and
     the message itself), can be found in the :guilabel:`Sent` column of the main :guilabel:`SMS
     Marketing` dashboard (while in :guilabel:`Kanban` view).

     For more detailed information, select a desired SMS from the main dashboard (in
     :guilabel:`Kanban` view), and click on either link in the blue banner above the SMS detail form
     to learn more.

#. | **Can I send as many SMSs I want at once?**
   | Yes, if you have enough credits.

#. | **If an SMS is sent to a number that doesn't exist in the list of recipients, will credits be
     lost?**
   | No, not if the phone number is incorrectly formatted (e.g. too many digits). However, if the
     SMS is sent to the wrong person (or to a fake number), the credit for that SMS will be lost.

#. | **What happens if I send my SMS to a paying number (e.g.: a contest to win a ticket for a
     festival)?**
   | The SMS will not be delivered to that kind of number, so no charges will be made.

#. | **Can I identify the numbers that do not exist when I send several SMSs?**
   | Only the ones that have an invalid format.

#. | **How does the GDPR regulation affect this service?**
   | Please find our `Privacy Policy here <https://iap.odoo.com/privacy#sms>`__.

#. | **Can I use my own SMS provider?**
   | Yes, but it is not possible out-of-the-box. Odoo experts can help customize a database to allow
     for the use of a personal SMS provider. Please check our success packs `here

On the :guilabel:`Reporting` page (accessible via the :menuselection:`Reporting` option in the
header menu), there are options to apply different combinations of :guilabel:`Filters` and
:guilabel:`Measures` to view metrics in a number of different layouts (e.g. :guilabel:`Graph`,
:guilabel:`List`, and :guilabel:`Cohort` views.)

Each :guilabel:`Reporting` metric view option allows for more extensive performance analysis of
:abbr:`SMS (Short Message Service)` mailings.

For example, while in the default :guilabel:`Graph` view, :abbr:`SMS (Short Message Service)` data
is visualized as different graphs and charts, which can be sorted and grouped in various ways (e.g.
:guilabel:`Measures` drop down menu).

   :align: center
   :alt: Reporting page in SMS Marketing.

.. tip::
   SMS messages can be sent using automation rules in Odoo. Odoo *Studio* is required to use
   automation rules.

   To install Odoo *Studio*, go to the :menuselection:`Apps application`. Then, using the
   :guilabel:`Search...` bar, search for `studio`.

   If it is not already installed, click :guilabel:`Install`.

   Adding the *Studio* application upgrades the subscription status to *Custom*, which increases the
   cost. Consult `support <https://www.odoo.com/contactus>`_, or reach out to the database's
   customer success manager, with any questions on making the change.

   To use automation rules, navigate in :ref:`developer mode <developer-mode>`, to
   :menuselection:`Settings app --> Technical menu --> Automation section --> Automation Rules`.
   Then, click :guilabel:`New` to create a new rule.

   Enter a name for the automation rule, and select a :guilabel:`Model` to implement this rule on.

   Based on the selection for the :guilabel:`Trigger`, additional fields will populate below. Set
   the :guilabel:`Trigger` to one of the following options:

   :guilabel:`Values Updated`

   - :guilabel:`User is set`
   - :guilabel:`State is set to`
   - :guilabel:`On archived`
   - :guilabel:`On unarchived`

   :guilabel:`Timing Conditions`

   - :guilabel:`Based on date field`
   - :guilabel:`After creation`
   - :guilabel:`After last update`

   :guilabel:`Custom`

   - :guilabel:`On save`
   - :guilabel:`On deletion`
   - :guilabel:`On UI change`

   :guilabel:`External`

   - :guilabel:`On webhook`

   Other options may appear based on the :guilabel:`Model` selected. For example if the
   :guilabel:`Calendar Event` model is selected, then the following options appear in addition to
   those above:

   :guilabel:`Email Events`

   - :guilabel:`On incoming message`
   - :guilabel:`On outgoing message`

   Under the :guilabel:`Before Update Domain` field, set a condition to be met before updating the
   record. Click :guilabel:`Edit Domain` to set record parameters.

   Under the :guilabel:`Actions To Do` tab, select :guilabel:`Add an action`. Next, in the resulting
   :guilabel:`Create Actions` pop-up window, select :guilabel:`Send SMS`, and set the
   :guilabel:`Allowed Groups`. :guilabel:`Allowed Groups` are the access rights groups that are
   allowed to execute this rule. Leave the field empty to allow all groups. See this documentation:
   :ref:`access-rights/groups`.

   Next, set the :guilabel:`SMS Template` and choose whether the SMS message should be logged as a
   note, by making a selection in the drop-down menu: :guilabel:`Send SMS as`. Click
   :guilabel:`Save and Close` to save the changes to this new action.

   .. image:: sms_analysis/automation-rule-sms.png

SMS Marketing
=============

Utilizing :abbr:`SMS (Short Message Service)` outreach in communication strategies can help
companies expand their market reach, especially in some countries, where emails might not be very
common, or even used at all.

Odoo's *SMS Marketing* application can also help boost conversion rates around valuable actions,
such as event registrations, free trials, purchases, etc., since text and mobile-based marketing
channels typically yield higher :abbr:`CTOR (click-to-open rate)` and :abbr:`CTR (click-through

      not work. In this case, you can use our Twilio integration to send SMS worldwide.

SMS marketing dashboard
=======================

When the application is opened, Odoo displays the main :guilabel:`SMS Marketing` dashboard, which
showcases the various SMS mailings that have been created, along with pertinent information and data
related to that specific message.

The :icon:`oi-view-kanban` :guilabel:`Kanban` view is the default Odoo uses when the application is
opened, which provides an organized display of the SMS mailings that have been created, and what
their current status is at the moment.

.. note::
   An :abbr:`SMS (Short Message Service)` mailing can have one of the following statuses:
   :guilabel:`Draft`, :guilabel:`In Queue`, :guilabel:`Sending`, or :guilabel:`Sent`.

In the upper right corner of the main :guilabel:`SMS Marketing` dashboard, there are a few different
view options to choose from. Each one provides a unique take on the same SMS information.

The :icon:`oi-view-list` :guilabel:`List` view provides the same useful data related to SMS
mailings, but in a more traditional list layout.

The :icon:`fa-calendar` :guilabel:`Calendar` view shows when SMS mailings are scheduled or have been
sent. Clicking a future date opens a blank SMS template to be scheduled for that date.

Lastly, the :icon:`fa-area-chart` :guilabel:`Graph` view visualizes that same SMS-related data in
series of graphs and charts. Odoo also provides various ways to sort and group the data for more
detailed analysis.

SMS via Twilio
==============

What is Twilio
==============

Twilio is a third-party provider that enables you to send SMS messages to your clients. Odoo
provides an easy way to use this service within your Odoo apps.

Why would I need it?
--------------------

Although Odoo already comes with an out-of-the-box (IAP) solution for SMS messages, it might not
work in some countries with stricter legal requirements. Currently, Odoo registers itself when
possible to avoid extra setup for its customers, however in some countries that is not enough and
the client itself must do it. This can be done through Twilio.

Setup your Twilio account
=========================

By creating a Twilio account, you will be able to create a virtual phone number from which you will
be able to send SMS messages. These cost credits that are to be bought on Twilio, not Odoo.

#. Go to `Twilio <https://www.twilio.com>`_
#. Sign up and create a Twilio account
#. Within your Twilio account, you can create multiple accounts (e.g. one for testing, one for each
   sub-company, etc.)
#. Create a new account

   #. Enter the name, and select :guilabel:`Twilio` for the type
   #. Select your :guilabel:`Billing Country` and click :guilabel:`Create new account`
   #. Select the different options that match your needs

      - For the :guilabel:`Twilio product`, select :guilabel:`SMS`
      - For :guilabel:`How to build with Twilio`, select :guilabel:`With no code at all`
      - For your :guilabel:`goal`, select :guilabel:`3rd party integrations`
   #. Click on :guilabel:`Get Started with Twilio`
#. You account is now created, and you should arrive on your :guilabel:`Dashboard`
#. Go to :menuselection:`Phone Numbers --> Manage --> Buy a number`
#. Buy a number (it is a paying service, but you should have received some credits to start with)
#. Go back to bottom of the :guilabel:`Dashboard` page
#. Copy the :guilabel:`Account SID` and :guilabel:`Auth Token`

.. important::
   In case of a testing account, you will only be able to send SMS to phones that you have verified
   within `Twilio's console <https://console.twilio.com>`_.

.. note::
   Sending SMS to some countries (such as the US or Canada) might require a registration. This can
   only be done by you, and not by Odoo. Please check out `Twilio's Help Center
   <https://help.twilio.com>`_.


Setup Odoo to use Twilio
========================

#. :ref:`Install <general/install>` the :guilabel:`Twilio SMS` module (`sms_twilio`)
#. In Odoo, go to :menuselection:`Settings --> General Settings --> Contacts --> Send SMS`, select
   :guilabel:`Send via Twilio` option, and save your change.
#. Go back to that option, and click :guilabel:`Configure Twilio Account`
#. Paste the copied credentials accordingly
#. Click on :guilabel:`Reload numbers`
#. Your newly bought phone number should appear in the list
#. You can use the :guilabel:`Test Number` field to send an SMS

You can have multiple numbers (for instance once per country, or one per campaign), in that case,
you can reorder the numbers. By default, when sending an SMS to a client, Odoo will select the
number whose country is the same as the client. If none matches, Odoo will use the first number
available from the list respecting the order you have chosen.

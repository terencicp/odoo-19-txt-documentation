Referrals
=========

Odoo's **Referrals** application is a centralized place where all information regarding referrals is
housed - from points earned, coworkers hired, and rewards selected. Users can recommend people they
know for job positions, and then earn referral points as those people progress through the
recruitment pipeline. Once enough referral points are earned, they can be exchanged for prizes. The
**Employees**, **Recruitment**, and **Website** apps must all be installed for the **Referrals** app
to function.

The only configurations needed for the **Referrals** app *after* it has been installed, are related
to the :doc:`rewards <referrals/rewards>`; everything else is preconfigured when Odoo **Referrals**
is installed.

Users with either :guilabel:`Referral User`, :guilabel:`Officer`, or :guilabel:`Administrator`
access rights for the **Recruitment** app can access the **Referrals** app. Only users with
:guilabel:`Administrator` access rights for the **Recruitment** app have access to the
:doc:`reporting <referrals/reporting>` and configuration menus. For more information on users and
access rights, refer to these documents: :doc:`../general/users` and
:doc:`../general/users/access_rights`.

.. _referrals/onboarding:

Onboarding
==========

When opening the **Referrals** app for the first time, a preconfigured onboarding script appears.
This script consists of four slides, each explaining the different parts of the **Referrals** app.
At the top of the dashboard, the following message is displayed throughout all the onboarding
slides: :guilabel:`GATHER YOUR TEAM! Job Referral Program`. Behind this main message is an image,
and beneath it some more explanatory text.

Each of the onboarding slides has a corresponding image and message that is displayed. After reading
each message, click the :guilabel:`Next` :icon:`fa-angle-right` button to advance to the next slide.

The text that appears on each slide is as follows:

#. :guilabel:`OH NO! VILLAINS ARE LURKING THE CITY! HELP US RECRUIT A TEAM OF SUPERHEROES TO SAVE
   THE DAY!`
#. :guilabel:`BROWSE THROUGH OPEN JOB POSITIONS, PROMOTE THEM ON SOCIAL MEDIA, OR REFER FRIENDS.`
#. :guilabel:`COLLECT POINTS AND EXCHANGE THEM FOR AWESOME GIFTS IN THE SHOP.`
#. :guilabel:`COMPETE AGAINST YOUR COLLEAGUES TO BUILD THE BEST JUSTICE LEAGUE!`

.. note::
   The onboarding slides will appear every time the **Referrals** app is opened, until all the
   slides have been viewed and the :guilabel:`Start Now` button has been clicked. If the onboarding
   is exited at any point, or if the :guilabel:`Start Now` button has *not* been clicked, the
   onboarding slides will begin again when the **Referrals** app is opened. Once the
   :guilabel:`Start Now` button has been clicked, the onboarding slides will not be seen again, and
   the main dashboard will load when the **Referrals** app is opened from that point on.

At any point during onboarding, click the :guilabel:`Skip` button to open the main **Referrals**
dashboard.

.. image:: referrals/onboarding.png
   :alt: An onboarding slide with the skip and next buttons visible at the bottom.

.. note::
   If there are any candidates hired that the user had referred prior to opening the **Referrals**
   app (meaning the onboarding slides have not appeared before), when :guilabel:`Start Now` is
   clicked at the end of onboarding, instead of going to the main dashboard, a :ref:`hired
   <referrals/hired>` screen appears instead.

Modifying onboarding slides
---------------------------

Onboarding slides can be modified if desired. Only users with :guilabel:`Administrator` rights for
the **Recruitment** app can modify onboarding slides. To edit a slide, navigate to
:menuselection:`Referrals app --> Configuration --> Onboarding.` Each line displays the text for the
individual onboarding slide. To edit an onboarding slide, click on an individual slide line to open
the slide's onboarding form.

Make any changes to the message in the :guilabel:`Text` field. A :guilabel:`Company` may be
selected, as well. However, if this field is populated, that slide is *only* displayed for that
particular company.

.. note::
   The :guilabel:`Company` field only appears when in a multi-company database.

The image can be modified, as well. Hover over the image thumbnail in the top-right corner of the
form. An :icon:`fa-pencil` :guilabel:`(Edit)` icon and :icon:`fa-trash-o` :guilabel:`(Clear)` icon
appear. Click the :icon:`fa-pencil` :guilabel:`(Edit)` icon to change the image. A file navigator
window loads. Navigate to the desired image, select it, then click :guilabel:`Open`. The new image
appears in the thumbnail. To delete an image, click the :icon:`fa-trash-o` :guilabel:`(Clear)` icon,
then select a new image using the :icon:`fa-pencil` :guilabel:`(Edit)` icon.

.. image:: referrals/edit-onboarding.png
   :alt: An onboarding slide in edit mode, with the main fields highlighted.

The sequence in which the slides appear can be changed from the *Onboarding* dashboard. Click the
:icon:`oi-draggable` :guilabel:`(draggable)` icon to the left of the slide text, and drag the slide
to the desired position.

.. image:: referrals/onboarding-reorder.png
   :alt: The onboarding slides in a list, with the drag and drop arrows highlighted.

.. _referrals/hired:

Hired referrals
===============

When a candidate referred by a user is hired, the user *"grows their superhero team"* and adds
superhero avatars to their **Referrals** dashboard.

After a referral has been hired, when the user next opens the **Referrals** app, instead of the main
dashboard, a hired page loads. The text :guilabel:`(REFERRAL NAME) HAS BEEN HIRED! Choose an avatar
for your new friend!` appears.

Below this message are five avatar thumbnails to choose from. If an avatar has already been assigned
to a referral, the thumbnail is grayed out, and the name that the avatar has been chosen for appears
beneath the avatar. Click on an available avatar to select it.

If more than one referral was hired since completing onboarding in the **Referrals** app, after
selecting the first avatar, the user is prompted to select another avatar for the subsequent hired
referral. Once all avatars have been selected, the dashboard loads and all the avatars are now
visible. Mouse over each avatar and their name is displayed above them.

.. image:: referrals/avatars.png
   :alt: The hired screen. A selection of avatars are presented to choose from, with any already
         chosen are greyed out.

Modify friends
--------------

Friend avatars are able to be modified in the same manner that :ref:`levels <referrals/levels>` are
modified. Only users with :guilabel:`Administrator` rights for the **Recruitment** app can make
modifications to friends. The preconfigured friends can be seen and modified by navigating to
:menuselection:`Referrals app --> Configuration --> Friends`. Each friend's avatar appears in the
:guilabel:`Dashboard Image` column, and the corresponding name appears in the :guilabel:`Friend
Name` column. The default images are a motley group of hero characters, ranging from robots to dogs.

To modify a friend's dashboard image, thumbnail, name, or position, click on an individual friend to
open the referral friend form. Type the name in the :guilabel:`Friend Name` field. The name is
solely to differentiate the friends in the configuration menu; the friend's name is not visible
anywhere else in the **Referrals** app.

The :guilabel:`Position` can be set to either :guilabel:`Front` or :guilabel:`Back`. This determines
the position of the friend in relation to the user's super hero avatar. Click the radio button next
to the desired selection, and the friend will appear either in front of or behind the user's avatar
when activated.

If desired, both the thumbnail :guilabel:`Image` and the :guilabel:`Dashboard Image` can be
modified. Hover over the image being replaced to reveal an  :icon:`fa-pencil` :guilabel:`(Edit)`
icon and :icon:`fa-trash-o` :guilabel:`(Clear)` icon. Click the :icon:`fa-pencil` :guilabel:`(Edit)`
icon, and a file explorer window appears. Navigate to the desired image file, then click
:guilabel:`Open` to select it.

To cancel any changes made, click the :icon:`fa-times` :guilabel:`(Discard all changes)` icon to
delete any changes, and revert to the original content.

.. image:: referrals/edit-friend.png
   :alt: A friend form in edit mode.

.. warning::
   It is not advised to edit the images. An image file must have a transparent background in order
   for it to render properly. Only users with knowledge about transparent images should attempt
   adjusting any images in the **Referrals** app.

   Once an image is changed and the friend is saved, it is **not possible** to revert to the
   original image. To revert to the original image, the **Referrals** app must be *uninstalled then
   reinstalled.*

.. _referrals/levels:

Levels
======

The **Referrals** app has preconfigured levels that are reflected in the user's avatar on the
**Referrals** dashboard. As a user refers potential employees and earns points, they can *level up*,
much like in a video game.

.. note::
   Levels have no functional impact on the performance of the app. They are solely used for the
   purpose of adding achievement tiers for participants to aim for, gamifying referrals for the
   user.

The user's current level is displayed at the top of the main **Referrals** app dashboard, directly
beneath their photo, in a :guilabel:`Level: #` format. In addition, a colored ring appears around
the user's photo, indicating how many points the user currently has, and how many additional points
they need to level up. The cyan colored portion of the ring represents points earned, while the
white colored portion represents the points still needed before they can level up.

Modify levels
-------------

Only users with :guilabel:`Administrator` rights for the **Recruitment** app can modify levels.

.. warning::
   It is not advised to edit the images. An image file must have a transparent background in order
   for it to render properly. Only users with knowledge about transparent images should attempt
   adjusting any images in the **Referrals** app.

   Once an image is changed and the level is saved, it is **not possible** to revert to the original
   image. To revert to the original image, the **Referrals** app must be *uninstalled then
   reinstalled.*

The preconfigured levels can be seen and modified by navigating to :menuselection:`Referrals app -->
Configuration --> Levels`. Each avatar appears in the :guilabel:`Image` column, and the
corresponding level number appears in the :guilabel:`Level Name` column. The default images are of
Odoo superheroes, and each level adds an additional element to their avatar, such as capes and
shields.

To modify a level's image, name, or points required to reach the level, click on an individual level
in the list to open the level form, then make modifications.

Type in the name (or number) of the level in the :guilabel:`Level Name` field. What is entered is
displayed beneath the user's photo on the main dashboard when they reach that level. Enter the
number of referral points needed to reach that level in the :guilabel:`Requirements` field. The
points needed to level up are the total accumulated points earned over the lifetime of the employee,
not additional points from the previous level that must be earned.

If desired, the :guilabel:`Image` can also be modified. Hover over the image to reveal an
:icon:`fa-pencil` :guilabel:`(Edit)` icon and a :icon:`fa-trash-o` :guilabel:`(Clear)` icon. Click
the :icon:`fa-pencil` :guilabel:`(Edit)` icon and a file explorer window appears. Navigate to the
desired image file, then click :guilabel:`Open` to select it.

To cancel any changes made, click the :icon:`fa-times` :guilabel:`(Discard all changes)` icon to
delete any changes, and revert to the original content.

.. image:: referrals/levels.png
   :alt: A level form in edit mode.

Level up
--------

Once enough points have been accumulated to level up, the circle around the user's photo is
completely filled in with a cyan color, a large image stating :guilabel:`LEVEL UP!` appears above
the photo, and the phrase :guilabel:`CLICK TO LEVEL UP!` appears beneath the user's photo and
current level.

Click on either the :guilabel:`LEVEL UP!` graphic, the user's photo, or the text :guilabel:`CLICK TO
LEVEL UP!` beneath the user's photo to level up the user. The user's avatar changes to the current
level, and the ring around the photo is updated to indicate the current amount of points.

Leveling up does not cost the user any points, the user only needs to earn the specified amount of
points required.

.. image:: referrals/level-up.png
   :alt: A 'Click to level up!' appears beneath the user's image, and a large 'Level up!' appears
         above their image.

.. note::
   Once a user has reached the highest configured level, they will continue to accrue points that
   can be redeemed for rewards, but they are no longer able to level up. The ring around their photo
   remains solid cyan.

Alerts
======

In the **Referrals** application, it is possible to post a message, also referred to as an *alert*,
at the top of the dashboard to share important information with users.

Alerts remain on the main **Referrals** dashboard for the specified amount of time configured on the
individual alert.

.. image:: alerts/alerts.png
   :alt: Two alert banners appear above the user's photo.

.. _referrals/create-alert:

Create an alert
===============

Only users with *Administrator* access rights for the **Recruitment** app can create alerts. To add
a new alert, navigate to the :menuselection:`Referrals app --> Configuration --> Alerts`.

Click :guilabel:`New` to open a blank alert form. Enter the following information on the form:

- :guilabel:`Date From`: the date the alert starts. On this date, the alert is visible on the
  dashboard.
- :guilabel:`Date To`: the date the alert ends. After this date, the alert is hidden from view.
- :guilabel:`Company`: the current company populates this field, by default. To modify the company
  the alert should be displayed for, select the desired company from the drop-down menu in this
  field.

  If this field remains blank, the alert is visible to everyone with access to the **Referrals**
  app.

  If a company is specified, only users within that company (who also have access to the
  **Referrals** app) see the alert. This field **only** appears in a multi-company database.
- :guilabel:`Alert`: enter the text for the alert. This message appears inside the alert banner on
  the main **Referrals** app dashboard.
- :guilabel:`On Click`: there are three options for the alert. Click the radio button next to the
  desired selection. The options are:

  - :guilabel:`Not Clickable`: the alert only displays text, there is no link to click.
  - :guilabel:`Go to All Jobs`: the alert contains a link that, when clicked, navigates to the
    website with all the job positions that are currently posted.
  - :guilabel:`Specify URL`: the alert contains a link to a specific URL that, when clicked,
    navigates to that URL. When selected, a :guilabel:`URL` field appears below the :guilabel:`On
    Click` section. Enter the desired URL in that field.

.. image:: alerts/alert-form.png
   :alt: An alert form completely filled in with all selections entered.

Notify users
============

In addition to posting an alert on the **Referrals** app, users can be contacted directly via email,
instead of waiting for users to view the alert when they open the **Referrals** app.

After :ref:`creating an alert <referrals/create-alert>`, click the :guilabel:`Send Mail` button
above the alert form. This causes a :guilabel:`Send Mail` pop-up window to load.

The currently configured users populate the :guilabel:`User` field, and the :guilabel:`Subject` is
populated with `New Alert In Referrals App`, by default.

The :guilabel:`Body` is populated with `A new alert has been added to the Referrals app! Check your
dashboard now!`, with the word `dashboard` linked to the **Referrals** app dashboard.

Make any desired modifications to the email, then click :guilabel:`Send`.

Dismiss an alert
================

It is possible to dismiss an alert, if a user does not wish to see a specific alert again.

To dismiss an alert, click the :icon:`fa-times` :guilabel:`(remove)` icon on the far-right side of
the alert on the **Referrals** app dashboard, to remove the alert.

This prevents the alert from appearing again, even when opening the **Referrals** app for the first
time in a new session.


==================================================

Referral points
===============

The *Referrals* application allows employees to earn points that are then exchanged for
:doc:`rewards <rewards>`.

Current referral points can be viewed on the main *Referrals* app dashboard, which appears when the
application is opened, after the :ref:`onboarding <referrals/onboarding>` slides have been viewed or
skipped.

At the top, a summary of the user's current points is displayed. The left side of the summary
displays the :guilabel:`Total` points earned, and the right side displays the points that are
available :guilabel:`To Spend`.

To view the various referral stages, and their respective earned points, click one of the referral
statuses beneath the avatar. The options are: :guilabel:`Referrals`, :guilabel:`Ongoing`, and
:guilabel:`Successful`.

The current number of referrals that are still active in the recruitment pipeline, but have not yet
been hired or refused, appear above :guilabel:`Ongoing`. The number of referrals that have been
hired, appears above :guilabel:`Successful`. The total number of referrals, both the ongoing and
successful referrals combined, appears above :guilabel:`Referrals`.

My referrals
============

To see all the referrals, both ongoing and successful, click :guilabel:`Referrals`. The
:guilabel:`My Referral` screen page displays all referrals, with each individual referral housed in
its own referral card.

A successful referral displays a white :icon:`fa-check` :guilabel:`Hired` badge in the top-right
corner of the card, along with a vertical green stripe on the left-side of the card. Referrals that
are in process have a purple :guilabel:`In Progress` badge in the top-right corner.

Each referral card lists the name of the applicant, the subject/application title as it appears on
the applicant card in the *Recruitment* app, the name of the job position, the person responsible
for filling the role (i.e. the recruiter), and the points earned.

For referrals that have been hired, the selected avatar also appears on the card.

.. image:: points/referrals.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Two referral cards, one hired and one in-progress.

Points
------

The points that can be earned for a referral are the same across all job positions. Each stage of
the recruitment process has corresponding points assigned to it. The stages listed correspond to the
stages configured in the *Recruitment* application.

On each individual referral card, beneath the points earned, is a progress bar that displays how
many points have been earned out of the total possible points that can be earned, if the applicant
is hired.

Beneath the bar chart is a list of the various recruitment stages, and the points earned when the
referral moves to that stage. If a stage has been achieved, and the points have been earned, a green
:icon:`fa-check` :guilabel:`(checkmark)` appears next to the stage.

.. note::
   The preconfigured point structure for referrals is as follows:

   - :guilabel:`Initial Qualification`: 1 point
   - :guilabel:`First Interview`: 20 points
   - :guilabel:`Second Interview`: 9 points
   - :guilabel:`Contract Proposal`: 5 points
   - :guilabel:`Contract Signed`: 50 points

   The default total points earned for a referral that is hired is 85 points. Modifications of the
   points earned for each stage are made in the *Recruitment* application. Refer to the
   :ref:`Recruitment <recruitment/modify-stages>` documentation to modify the points for each stage.

Reporting
=========

The reporting function in the **Referrals** app helps recruiters and managers learn where applicants
are applying from, when referred by a current employee. Additionally, the reporting feature shows
the number of applicants hired, refused, and still in the recruitment pipeline, for each medium.

.. important::
   Only users with *Administrator* rights for the **Recruitment** app have access to the reporting
   feature in the **Referrals** app.

Employees referral analysis report
==================================

To access the *Employees Referral Analysis* report, navigate to :menuselection:`Referrals app -->
Reporting`. This loads the :guilabel:`Employees Referral Analysis` report, in a default
:icon:`fa-bar-chart` :guilabel:`Bar Chart`.

The graph is presented in a :icon:`fa-database` :guilabel:`Stacked` view, with the number of
referrals on the y-axis, and the source, referred to as the :guilabel:`Medium`, of the applicant
(e.g.: *Facebook*, *LinkedIn*, *Email*, etc.) on the x-axis. If a medium does **not** appear on the
report, that indicates there are no referrals from that particular medium.

Referral amounts for all stages are displayed, including :guilabel:`Not Hired` (refused),
:guilabel:`In Progress`, and :guilabel:`Hired`. The default filter is set to the current month.

Hover over any bar to view a popover containing specific data for that particular bar.

In this view, it is clear which :guilabel:`Medium` is the most successful.

.. example::
   In this example, both :guilabel:`Email` and :guilabel:`LinkedIn` are the mediums with the most
   referrals, but :guilabel:`Email` has the most referrals that were hired.

   .. image:: reporting/employee-report.png
      :alt: The default report in the Referrals app.

Use case: hired referrals
-------------------------

One way to use the reporting feature is to assess which employees are referring the highest quality
applicants. This is done by examining how many of their referrals go on to become employees.

In this example, data is examined to determined which employee has the highest number of hired
referrals for the current year.

To view this information, first click the :icon:`oi-view-pivot` :guilabel:`(Pivot)` icon in the
upper-right corner. Next, remove the current filter in the search bar.

Click the :icon:`fa-caret-down` :guilabel:`(down arrow)` in the search bar to reveal a drop-down
menu. Click :guilabel:`Date` in the :icon:`fa-filter` :guilabel:`Filters` column, revealing a
drop-down menu of available time periods, and click the current year (in this example,
:guilabel:`2024`).

Next, click :guilabel:`Measures` :icon:`fa-caret-down`, then deselect :guilabel:`Earned Points` and
:guilabel:`Employee Referral Refused` to hide those metrics. Click anywhere on the screen to close
the drop-down menu.

The information displayed shows how many total applicants each employee referred, and how many of
those applicants were hired, for the current year.

In this example, it can be determined that :guilabel:`Bob Wilson` is the most successful referrer,
with three hired referrals, and nine total referred applicants. Additionally, :guilabel:`Mitchell
Admin` has the lowest performance in terms of referrals, as he has only one applicant, and no hires.

This information can be helpful to the recruitment team, so they can determine the most active
referrers in the company, and who is the most successful in terms of hires.

.. image:: reporting/employee-counts.png
   :alt: The customized report showing which employees have the most referrals and hires.

.. tip::
   The pivot table can be inserted into a new or existing :doc:`spreadsheet
   <../../productivity/spreadsheet/insert>`, if desired.

   To do so, click the :guilabel:`Insert in Spreadsheet` button right above the chart. A pop-up
   window appears, asking which spreadsheet to insert the pivot chart into. Select the desired
   spreadsheet or dashboard from the presented options. Alternatively, select :guilabel:`Blank
   Spreadsheet` to create a new one.

   Click :guilabel:`Confirm`, and the selected spreadsheet loads, with the new table in it.

   The spreadsheet is stored in the **Documents** application. This application **must** be
   installed to use the :guilabel:`Insert in Spreadsheet` option.

Rewards
=======

After employees have successfully earned referral points, they can exchange their points by
purchasing rewards in Odoo's **Referrals** application. Rewards **must** be :ref:`created and
configured <referrals/create>` before employees can :ref:`redeem points for rewards
<referrals/redeem>`.

.. _referrals/create:

Create rewards
==============

Rewards are the only configurations needed when setting up the **Referrals** application.

Only users with :guilabel:`Administrator` rights for the **Recruitment** application can create or
modify rewards.

.. seealso::
   :doc:`../../general/users/access_rights`

To add rewards, navigate to :menuselection:`Referrals app --> Configuration --> Rewards`. Click
:guilabel:`New`, and a reward form loads. Enter the following information on the form:

- :guilabel:`Product Name`: enter the name as it should appear for the reward. This field is
  required.
- :guilabel:`Cost`: enter the amount of points required to redeem the reward.
- :guilabel:`Company`: using the drop-down menu, select the company the reward is configured for. If
  a reward is available for multiple companies, each company **must** configure a reward for their
  specific company. This field **only** appears if in a multi-company environment; if this field
  appears, it is required.

  .. example::
     A corporation with three different companies offers a gift card as a reward. In the database,
     there are three separate rewards listed for a gift card, one for each of the three companies.

- :guilabel:`Gift Responsible`: using the drop-down menu, select the person responsible for
  procuring and delivering the reward to the recipient. This person is alerted when the reward is
  bought in the **Referrals** app, so they know when to deliver the reward to the recipient.
- :guilabel:`Photo`: add a photo of the reward, which appears on the rewards page. Hover over the
  image box in the top-right corner (a square with a camera and plus sign inside it), and a
  :icon:`fa-pencil` :guilabel:`(pencil)` icon appears. Click the :icon:`fa-pencil`
  :guilabel:`(pencil)` icon to select and add a photo to the reward form. Once a photo is added,
  hovering over the image reveals two icons instead of one: a :icon:`fa-pencil` :guilabel:`(pencil)`
  icon and a :icon:`fa-trash-o` :guilabel:`(trash can)` icon. Click the :icon:`fa-trash-o`
  :guilabel:`(trash can)` icon to delete the currently selected image.
- :guilabel:`Description` tab: type in the description for the reward. This is visible on the reward
  card, beneath the title. This field is required.

.. image:: rewards/rewards.png
   :alt: A filled out reward form with all details entered.

.. important::
   It is advised to enter a :guilabel:`Cost` and add a :guilabel:`Photo`. If a cost is not entered,
   the default cost is listed as zero, which would list the reward as free in the reward shop. If a
   photo is not selected, a placeholder icon is displayed on the rewards page.

.. _referrals/redeem:

Redeem rewards
==============

In order to redeem a reward, points must be earned. These points can then be used to purchase a
reward.

To purchase a reward, click the :guilabel:`Rewards` button on the main :guilabel:`Referrals`
dashboard. All the configured rewards are listed in individual reward cards.

The required point amount needed to purchase a reward is listed in the top-right corner of the card.

If the user has enough points to purchase a reward, a :icon:`fa-shopping-basket` :guilabel:`Buy`
button appears at the bottom of the reward card. If they do not have enough points for a reward, the
reward card displays :guilabel:`You need another (x) points to buy this`, instead of a
:icon:`fa-shopping-basket` :guilabel:`Buy` button.

Click the :icon:`fa-shopping-basket` :guilabel:`Buy` button on a reward to purchase it. A
:guilabel:`Confirmation` pop-up window appears, asking if the user is sure they want to purchase the
reward. Click :guilabel:`OK` to purchase the item, or :guilabel:`Cancel` to close the window, and
cancel the purchase.

After :guilabel:`OK` is clicked, the pop-up window closes, and the points used to purchase the
reward are subtracted from the user's available points. The rewards presented are now updated to
reflect the user's current available points.

Share job positions
===================

In Odoo **Referrals**, users can earn referral points by sharing job positions with potential
applicants. Individual job positions can be shared in several ways: via :ref:`email
<referrals/email>`, :ref:`SMS <referrals/sms>`, :ref:`WhatsApp <referrals/whatsapp>`, a
:ref:`tracking link <referrals/link>`, and various :ref:`social media platforms <referrals/social>`.

Additionally, *all* job positions can be :ref:`shared via email <referrals/email-jobs>`, instead of
sharing individual job positions.

.. note::
   Sharing jobs can **only** occur after :ref:`onboarding <referrals/onboarding>` slides have been
   viewed or skipped.

.. _referrals/view-jobs:

View all jobs
=============

To see all job positions that are actively recruiting candidates, click the :guilabel:`View Jobs`

presented with its own card.

.. image:: share_jobs/jobs.png
   :alt: The View Jobs screen, displaying all current open job positions. All information is

Each job position card contains the following information:

- The title of the job position. This information is taken from the *Job Position* field of the job

Share an individual job
=======================

To share an individual job position, first click the :guilabel:`View Jobs` button on the main
**Referrals** app dashboard. This presents a list of all currently published jobs. From this page,
an individual job can be shared with someone using one of the methods below.

.. _referrals/email:

Send email
----------

To share an individual job position via email, click the :icon:`fa-envelope-o` :guilabel:`Send
Email` button on the specific job position card. A preconfigured email template appears in a pop-up
window, using the :guilabel:`Send Job Offer by Mail` template. Enter the recipient's email address
in the :guilabel:`Email` field.

The :guilabel:`Subject` and :guilabel:`Body` are populated using a default template. The
:guilabel:`Subject` `Job for you` is present, by default, but can be modified, if desired.

The specific title of the job position populates the *Job Position* placeholder in the email body.
The `See Job Offer` text in the email body is an individualized tracking link to the specific job
position listed on the website.

When the prospective employee receives the email, the link sends them to the job position page,
where they can apply for the position, and the person who referred them is tracked in the
**Referrals** app.

If desired, add any text or closing salutation to the email body. When all edits have been made,
click :guilabel:`Send Mail` to send the email, or click :guilabel:`Cancel` to close the pop-up
window.

Other than sending an email, SMS, WhatsApp message, or sharing a tracking link, job positions can be
shared via social media platforms (:ref:`Facebook <referrals/facebook>`, :ref:`X <referrals/x>`, and
:ref:`LinkedIn <referrals/linkedin>`. On each job position card are the three corresponding social

with the tracking link attached.

Type in any additional information to add to the post, then share the job position using the
available options in Facebook.

.. _referrals/email-jobs:

Share job list
==============

Another way to share job opportunities is to share the entire current list of open job positions,
instead of one job position at a time. To do this, navigate to the :menuselection:`Referrals` main
dashboard. Click the :guilabel:`Email a friend` button at the bottom of the screen. A
:guilabel:`Send Job Offer by Mail` pop-up window appears.

Enter the email address in the :guilabel:`Email` field. The email can be sent to multiple recipients
by separating each email address with a comma followed by a single space. The :guilabel:`Subject` is
preconfigured with :guilabel:`Job for you`, but can be edited. The email :guilabel:`Body` is also
populated with preconfigured text.

The link to all active job positions is a tracking link to a complete list of all job positions
currently being recruited for. Add any additional text and make any edits to the message body, if
necessary. Then, click :guilabel:`Send Mail` to send the email. This sends the message, and closes
the window.

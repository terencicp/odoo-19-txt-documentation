Dashboard
=========

Upon opening the **Rental** application, the :guilabel:`Rental Orders` dashboard is revealed.

.. image:: rental/rental-orders-dashboard.png
   :alt: Example of the Rental Orders dashboard available in the Odoo Rental application.

In the default Kanban view, all rentals are visible. Each rental card displays the customer name,
the price of the rental, the related sales order number, along with the status of the rental.

On the left sidebar, the :guilabel:`Rental Status` for each rental can be found. Beneath that, the
:guilabel:`Invoice Status` of the rentals is accessible. Clicking any option in the left sidebar
filters the displayed rentals on the dashboard.

Settings
========

To configure additional rental delay costs, availability of rental items, or minimum time of rental,
navigate to :menuselection:`Rental app --> Configuration --> Settings`.

.. image:: rental/rental-settings.png
   :alt: How the Settings page appears in the Odoo Rental application.

In the :guilabel:`Rental` section, there are options to configure :guilabel:`Default Delay Costs`
and :guilabel:`Default Padding Time`. Also, there is the option to activate :guilabel:`Rental
Transfers`.

- :guilabel:`Default Delay Costs` are additional costs for late returns.
- :guilabel:`Default Padding Time` represents the minimum amount of time between two rentals.
- :guilabel:`Rental Transfers` means stock deliveries and receipts can be used for rental orders.

In the :guilabel:`Rent Online` section, there are options to configure a :guilabel:`Minimal Rental
Duration` and designate :guilabel:`Unavailability days`, or days during which pickup and return are
not possible.

Rental products
===============

To view all products that can rented in the database, navigate to :menuselection:`Rentals app -->
Products`. By default, the :guilabel:`Rental` search filter appears in the search bar.

Each product Kanban card displays that product's name, rental price, and product image (if
applicable).

.. _rental/pricing:

Rental pricing
==============

To adjust the rental pricing on a product, go to the :guilabel:`Products` page in the **Rental**
app, then select the desired product or click :guilabel:`New` to create a new product from scratch.

On the product form, ensure the :guilabel:`Rental` checkbox is ticked. Then, open the
:guilabel:`Rental prices` tab.

.. image:: rental/rental-prices-tab.png
   :alt: How the Settings page appears in the Odoo Rental application.

Pricing
-------

Under the :guilabel:`Pricing` section of the :guilabel:`Rental prices` tab, designate custom rental
prices and rental periods for the product.

To add pricing for a rental, click :guilabel:`Add a price`. Then, choose a *pricing period*
(:dfn:`the unit of duration of the rental`) in the :guilabel:`Period` column, or create a new
pricing period by typing in the name and clicking :guilabel:`Create`.

Next, decide whether or not to apply this custom rental price to a specific :guilabel:`Pricelist`.

Lastly, enter the desired :guilabel:`Price` for that specific :guilabel:`Period`.

.. note::
   No limit exists on how many pricing lines can be added. Multiple pricing options for rental
   products are typically used to give discounts for customers who agree to longer rental durations.

.. note::
    Remember when considering pricing that renting for a day is usually limited to operating hours,
    not 24 hours. When determining pricing, keep in mind that a rental day typically refers to
    operating hours, not a full 24-hour period.

Reservations
------------

Under the :guilabel:`Reservations` section of the :guilabel:`Rental prices` tab, there is the option
to configure additional fines for any :guilabel:`Hourly Fine` or :guilabel:`Daily Fine` that the
customer takes to return a rental.

Also, there is the option to set the :guilabel:`Reserve product` time, expressed in hours, to make the rental
product temporarily unavailable between two rental orders. Such a feature may prove useful if
maintenance or cleaning is required between rentals.

Price computing
---------------

Odoo always uses two rules to compute the price of a product when a rental order is created:

#. Only one price line is used.
#. The cheapest line is selected.

.. exercise::
   Consider the following rental pricing configuration for a product:

   - 1 day: $100
   - 3 days: $250
   - 1 week: $500

   A customer wants to rent this product for eight days. What price will they pay?

   After an order is created, Odoo selects the second line as this is the cheapest option. The
   customer has to pay three times '3 days' to cover the rental's eight days, for a total of $750.

==================================================
SECTION: manage_deposits.rst

==================================================

===============
Manage deposits
===============

Requiring fixed deposits is common in many rental scenarios; such as collecting security deposits.

This document covers the standard options for :ref:`configuring <rental/manage_deposits/config>`,
:ref:`collecting <rental/manage_deposits/product>` and :ref:`refunding
<rental/manage_deposits/refund>` deposits within the **Rentals** app.

.. _rental/manage_deposits/config:

Configuration
-------------

First, create a *deposit service product* for each rental product that requires a deposit.

To do so, go to :menuselection:`Rental --> Products` and create a :guilabel:`New` product.

On the product form, give the product a name that indicates it is a deposit.

.. example::
   If this deposit service product is intended for the *Digital Camera* rental product, the name may
   be entered as `Digital Camera Deposit`.

Next, set the :guilabel:`Product Type` to :guilabel:`Service`, the :guilabel:`Invoicing Policy` to
:guilabel:`Delivered quantities` and then assign a :guilabel:`Sales Price` with the amount to
collect for the deposit. Choose whether or not to include :guilabel:`Sales Taxes` for this deposit
service product.

Finally, :icon:`fa-cloud-upload` :guilabel:`(save)` the deposit service product.

.. _rental/manage_deposits/product:

Collect deposits from an optional product
-----------------------------------------

On the rental product's form, go to the :guilabel:`Sales` tab and add the :ref:`deposit service
product <rental/manage_deposits/config>` to the :guilabel:`Optional Products`.

Be sure to configure the rental product's prices on the :ref:`Rental prices <rental/pricing>` tab.

With the above configuration, a :ref:`rental order <rental/order>` can be created.

.. important::
   After selecting the rental product in the :guilabel:`Order Lines` tab, be sure to :icon:`fa-plus`
   :guilabel:`Add` the deposit service product in the :guilabel:`Configure your product` pop-up.

   The :guilabel:`Configure your product` pop-up only appears if the optional product is set on the
   rental product.

.. tip::
   If :doc:`eCommerce <../../websites/ecommerce>` is installed, add an :guilabel:`Ecommerce
   Description` stating the deposit is required in the rental product's :guilabel:`Sales` tab.

   When a customer adds the rental product to their cart, a :guilabel:`Configure your product`
   pop-up displays the deposit service product under :guilabel:`Available options`.

   Once the customer clicks :icon:`fa-shopping-cart` :guilabel:`Add` the rental product and the
   deposit service product are added to their cart.

.. image:: manage_deposits/optional-product.png
   :alt: A deposit service product listed in the rental quotation.

.. _rental/manage_deposits/refund:

Refund deposits upon return
---------------------------

Once a customer :ref:`returns the rented product <rental/return-products>`, reimburse their deposit with a
:doc:`credit note <../../finance/accounting/customer_invoices/credit_notes>` from the invoice, and
change the *delivered quantity* to `0` on the linked sales order.

product image (if applicable).

Create a new physical product
=============================

To set up a new physical rental product, go to the :menuselection:`Rental app --> Products`, then
click :guilabel:`New`. In the new product window, the :guilabel:`Rental` checkbox is already ticked
by default.

.. image:: products/new-product.png
   :alt: The new product view in the Rental app.

Select the :guilabel:`Product Type` as :guilabel:`Goods` and tick the :guilabel:`Track Inventory`
checkbox. Next to the :guilabel:`Track Inventory` checkbox, select the :guilabel:`By Unique Serial

Click the :guilabel:`Rental prices` tab and in the :guilabel:`Pricing` section, click :guilabel:`Add
a price` to enter a new rental rate. Choose a *pricing period* (:dfn:`the unit of duration of the
rental`) in the :guilabel:`Period` column, or create a new pricing period by typing in the name and
clicking :guilabel:`Create and edit`.

.. note::
   Creating a new pricing period opens a pop-up :guilabel:`Create period` window. Fill in the
   :guilabel:`Name`, :guilabel:`Duration`, and :guilabel:`Unit`, and click :guilabel:`Save`. The new
   pricing period automatically applies.

   .. image:: products/new-rental-period.png
      :alt: Sample of a New Period view in the Rental app.

Next, enter the :guilabel:`Price` for that specific :guilabel:`Period`. To apply the configured
rental rate to an existing pricelist, click in the :guilabel:`Pricelist` column and select the
desired list from the drop-down menu.

In the :guilabel:`Reservations` section, fill in the :guilabel:`Hourly Fine`, :guilabel:`Daily
Fine`, and the :guilabel:`Reserve product` time. These values are automatically populated from the
:guilabel:`Default Delay Costs` section, provided they have been configured in the
:menuselection:`Rental app --> Configuration --> Settings`.

Click the :icon:`fa-cloud-upload` :guilabel:`(Save manually)` icon near the top to save.

.. example::
   A bike rental business only rents out tandem bikes for the local park for two hours. The hourly
   rental rate for their tandem bikes is $20, but since tandem bikes are popular they want to set a
   fixed price of $35. To ensure the business gets their bikes returned on time they set the late
   return fee as $20 per hour and $160 per day ($20 x 8 hrs).

   Create a new pricing period by navigating to :menuselection:`Rental app --> Configuration -->
   Rental periods`. Click :guilabel:`New` and configure a the period for 2 hours.

   Navigate to the tandem bike product and in the :guilabel:`Rental prices` tab and add the 2 hour
   period set at $35. Manually save to apply changes.

Create a rental order
=====================

To create a rental order in the *Rental* app, navigate to :menuselection:`Rental app --> Orders -->
Orders`, and click :guilabel:`New`. Doing so reveals a blank rental order form.

.. image:: products/rental-order.png
   :alt: Sample of a filled out rental order available in the Odoo Rental application.

Start by adding a :guilabel:`Customer`, then configure the desired duration of the rental in the
:guilabel:`Rental period` field.

To adjust the rental duration, click the first date in the :guilabel:`Rental period` field, and

Once complete, click :guilabel:`Apply` in the calendar pop-up form. Following that, the pop-up form
disappears, and the designated time period of the rental is represented in the :guilabel:`Duration`
field.

Next, add a rental product in the :guilabel:`Order Lines` tab, by clicking :guilabel:`Add a
product`, and selecting the desired rental product to add to the form.

.. note::
   If a rental product is added *before* the :guilabel:`Rental period` field has been properly
   configured, the user can *still* adjust the :guilabel:`Rental period` field accordingly.

   Select the desired range of dates to represent the duration of the rental, then click
   :guilabel:`Update Rental Prices` in the :guilabel:`Duration` field.

   .. image:: products/rental-update-rental-prices.png

:guilabel:`Validate` on the Payment page.

.. image:: products/payment-page-validate.png
   :alt: Sample of the Payment page in the Rental app.

Customer signature
==================

Odoo has the ability to request the customer sign a rental agreement, outlining the arrangement
between the company and customer, *before* they pick up the rental products. Such documents can
ensure everything is returned on-time and in its original condition.

.. note::
   Requesting a signature can be done during any stage of the order. This feature also requires the
   :doc:`Sign <../../productivity/sign>` app.

If signatures are required, go to the **Rental** app and from the default :guilabel:`Rental Orders`
dashboard, select the desired rental order. To go the :icon:`fa-cog` :guilabel:`(Actions)` icon, and
click :guilabel:`Request Signature`.

.. image:: products/request-signature.png
   :alt: The Request Signature option in the Odoo Rental application.

A :guilabel:`Sign Documents` pop-up window displays. Select the desired document from the
:guilabel:`Template` drop-down menu.

.. image:: products/sign-documents-popup.png
   :alt: The Sign Documents pop-up window that appears in the Odoo Rental application.

Doing so reveals a :guilabel:`New Signature Request` pop-up window. Upon confirming the information
in the :guilabel:`New Signature Request` pop-up form, click :guilabel:`Send` to initiate the signing
process.

.. image:: products/new-signature-request-form.png
   :alt: The New Signature Request pop-up window that appears in the Odoo Rental application.

A link to the signature request will appear in the record's chatter. The document is accessible to
the customer via the customer portal or email.

When the customer clicks :guilabel:`Sign document`, a separate page is then revealed, showcasing the
document to be signed. The customer begins the process by clicking :guilabel:`Click to start`. The
app guides the signee to the required signature locations and allows them to create electronic
signatures to complete the form.

.. image:: products/adopt-signature-popup.png
   :alt: The adopt your signature pop-up window that appears in the Odoo Rental application.

Once the document has been signed and completed, click :guilabel:`Validate & Send Completed
Document` at the bottom of the document. Odoo presents the option to download the signed document

Multi-location management and transfers
=======================================

Tracking the location of high-value physical products between locations is essential. The **Rental**
app helps with the *Rental Transfers* feature. Activating rental transfers means the system treats
rental movements similarly to sales, requiring a receipt and a delivery order every time a physical
product is rented or returned.

For multi-location management and rental item transfer tracking, navigate to the
:menuselection:`Rental app > Configuration > Settings` and in the :guilabel:`Rental` section, tick
the :guilabel:`Rental Transfers` checkbox.

.. image:: products/rental-transfers-checkbox.png
   :alt: Sample of the Rental settings with the Rental Transfers enabled.

.. note::
   The **Inventory** app automatically creates an internal default location once the *Rental
   Transfers* feature is enabled. Odoo uses the new default location, :guilabel:`Customer/Rental`,
   to track products during the rental period (moving them from :guilabel:`Stock` to
   :guilabel:`Customer/Rental` upon rental, and back upon return). Do not modify to avoid corrupting
   inventory tracking.

Next, go to the :menuselection:`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings` and in the
:guilabel:`Warehouse` section, tick the :guilabel:`Storage Locations` checkbox. Click
:guilabel:`Save` to apply the changes.

To configure new locations, navigate to :menuselection:`Inventory app --> Configuration -->
Locations`. Click :guilabel:`New` to configure a new internal location.

On the new location page, enter the :guilabel:`Location Name` and ensure the :guilabel:`Parent
Location` field is set to :guilabel:`WH`. Click the :icon:`fa-cloud-upload` :guilabel:`Save
manually` icon near the top to save.

.. example::
   A bike rental business has two store locations within the same city. Both locations allow for
   pick-up and drop-off of their bikes. The company wants to track its bikes accurately at each
   location.

   Ensure the **Rental** and **Inventory** apps are configured by enabling :guilabel:`Rental
   Transfers` in the **Rental app** and :guilabel:`Storage Locations` in the **Inventory** app.

   Next, go to the :menuselection:`Inventory app > Configuration > Locations`. Create a new location
   for each storefront.

   .. image:: products/configured-locations.png
      :alt: Sample of internal inventory locations that represent different rental store locations.

Pickup products
===============

When a customer picks up products, navigate to the appropriate rental order, click
:guilabel:`Pickup`. The **Rental** app displays a warehouse delivery form listing the reserved
rental products. Click :guilabel:`Validate` to move the order to the :guilabel:`Done` stage.

.. image:: products/pickup-page.png
   :alt: Sample of a Pickup page in the Rental app.

Doing so places a :guilabel:`Pickedup` status banner on the rental order.

.. _rental/return-products:

Return products
===============

When a customer returns products, navigate to the desired rental order, click :guilabel:`Return`.
The **Rental** app displays a warehouse receipt form listing the checked out rental products.

Enter the same amount of products the customer returned in the :guilabel:`Quantity` column. If any
of the products have serial numbers, enter them into the :guilabel:`Serial Numbers` column.

.. image:: products/return-page.png
   :alt: Sample of the Return page in the Rental app.

Click :guilabel:`Validate` to move the order to the :guilabel:`Done` stage. A :guilabel:`Returned`
status banner appears on the rental order.

Print pickup and return receipts
================================

Pickup and return receipts can be printed for customers when they pick up and/or return rental
products.

To print pickup and/or return receipts, navigate to the appropriate rental order, click the
:icon:`fa-cog` :guilabel:`(Actions)` icon to reveal a drop-down menu.

.. image:: products/print-pickup-return-receipt.png
   :alt: The pickup and return receipt print option in the Odoo Rental application.

From this drop-down menu, hover over the :guilabel:`Print` option to reveal a sub-menu. Then select
:guilabel:`Pickup and Return Receipt`.

Odoo generates and downloads a PDF, detailing all information about the current status of the rented
items.

Service rental products
=======================

The **Rental** app is a comprehensive tool that enables users to manage the scheduling, pricing, and
inventory for both physical goods (products) and non-physical goods (services) within a single
platform.

This flexibility allows for combining products and services like bike rentals with guided tours, or
booking a studio with a photographer.

This document covers how to configure a rental service to automatically sync with staff shifts,
track time sheet hours, and set up and link project tasks based on a rental order.

Settings

:guilabel:`Apply after` field.

.. note::
   For finer control, configure the costs of late returns for the :guilabel:`Per Hour` and
   :guilabel:`Per Day` fields at the product level. If the defaults apply to all products, leave the
   :guilabel:`Product` field blank.

In the :guilabel:`Default Padding Time` section, fill in the :guilabel:`Padding` field.

Next, enable :guilabel:`Rental Transfers`. In the :guilabel:`Rent Online` section, fill in the
:guilabel:`Minimal Rental Duration` field and designate :guilabel:`Unavailability days`. Click
:guilabel:`Save` to apply the changes.

The following apps are essential for workflow efficiency and automation when creating a service
product and rental order:

 - **Sales** app: Enables the use of online payments and utilizes quotation templates within the
   **Rental** app.
 - **Sign** app: Allows for the upload and customization of different rental and service agreements.
   These documents are used to facilitate the :guilabel:`Request Signature` feature.
 - **Project** and **Planning** apps: Integrate with the Rental app to automatically match purchased
   products and services with employees based on availability.

they are referred to as rental orders.

Navigate to the **Rental** app which opens the Rental Orders dashboard. Click :guilabel:`New` to
open a new rental order form.

Enter the :guilabel:`Customer` field, and select a :guilabel:`Quotation Template`, if applicable.

Next, set the desired rental duration in the :guilabel:`Rental period` field. To adjust the rental
duration, click the first date in the :guilabel:`Rental period` field, and select the range of dates
and times to represent the rental duration from the pop-up calendar form that appears.

Once complete, click :guilabel:`Apply` in the calendar pop-up form. Following that, the pop-up form
disappears, and the designated rental time period is represented in the :guilabel:`Duration` field.

Next, add a rental service in the :guilabel:`Order Lines` tab, by clicking :guilabel:`Add a product`
and selecting the desired rental service to add to the form. Enter the desired amount in the
:guilabel:`Quantity` column.

.. note::
   If a rental product is added before the Rental period field has been properly configured, the
   user can still adjust the Rental period field accordingly. Select the desired range of dates to
   represent the duration of the rental, then click Update Rental Prices in the Duration field.

email the quotation to the customer. When the customer approves the quotation, click
:guilabel:`Confirm`. A banner displays on the rental order stating its current status.

Customer signature
==================

Odoo enables electronic signature requests for customer service agreements and any other documents
that require signatures. Service agreements detail the business relationship and mutual duties.
These agreements protect both the provider and the customer by creating clear, enforceable
guidelines.

If signatures are required, go to the **Rental** app and from the default :guilabel:`Rental Orders`
dashboard, select the desired rental order. Click the :icon:`fa-cog` :guilabel:`(Actions)` icon, and
click :guilabel:`Request Signature`.

.. image:: service_products/request-signature.png
   :alt: The Action drop-down menu for requesting a signature in the Rental app.

A :guilabel:`New Signature Request` pop-up window displays. Select the desired document from the
:guilabel:`Template` drop-down menu.

.. image:: service_products/new-signature-request.png
   :alt: Sample of the New Signature Request pop-up window in the Rental app.

Doing so reveals a :guilabel:`New Signature Request` pop-up window. Upon confirming the information
in the :guilabel:`New Signature Request` pop-up form, click :guilabel:`Send` to initiate the signing
process.

.. image:: service_products/new-signature-request-message.png
   :alt: Sample of the New Signature Request message in the Rental app.

A link to the signature request will appear in the chatter of the rental order. The document is
accessible to the customer via the customer portal or email.

.. note::
   Requesting an electronic signature can be done at any stage of the order. This feature requires
   the **Sign** app. Typically, rental or service agreements are signed **after the rental order is
   confirmed** to establish the responsibilities and terms for the parties involved.

.. important::
   The :guilabel:`Request Signature` feature only allows the customer to sign the document through
   their email or customer portal. The customer cannot sign the document through the user's **Sign**
   app.

Signing a document from an email link
-------------------------------------

When a customer clicks :guilabel:`Sign document`, a separate page is then revealed, showcasing the
document to be signed. The customer begins the process by clicking :guilabel:`Click` to start.

The app guides the signer to the required signature locations and allows them to create electronic
signatures to complete the form.

The *Adopt your signature* pop-up window that appears in the Odoo Rental application. Once the
document has been signed and completed, click :guilabel:`Validate & Send Completed Document` at the
bottom of the document.

Odoo presents the option to download the signed document for record-keeping purposes, if necessary.

Entering time for the rental order
==================================

.. important::
   For the appropriate smart buttons to display, the **Project**, **Timesheet**, and **Planning**
   apps are needed. The selected service product on the rental order must be :ref:`properly
   configured <rental/service_products/service>` to integrate with the recommended apps.

Navigate to the rental orders by :menuselection:`Rental app --> Orders --> Orders` and select the
desired rental order. At the top of the rental order form, the following smart buttons appear:

- :icon:`fa-puzzle-piece` :guilabel:`Tasks`: Linked to the **Projects** app and shows any projects
     or tasks related to the rental order.
- :icon:`fa-clock-o` :guilabel:`Recorded`: Linked to the **Timesheets** app and shows how many hours
     are related to the rental order.
- :icon:`fa-tasks` :guilabel:`Planned`: Linked to the **Planning** app and shows how many shifts are
     related to the rental order.

Click the :icon:`fa-puzzle-piece` :guilabel:`Tasks` smart button to view a Kanban view of all the
associated tasks that were automatically created when confirming the rental order. Click the desired
task, then select the :guilabel:`Timesheets` tab.

.. note::
   Once time is added to the :guilabel:`Timesheets` tab  of a task, the status of the rental order
   is automatically changed to :guilabel:`Picked-up` and the :guilabel:`Return` button appears.

Create an invoice
=================

Go to the desired invoice by navigating to the :menuselection:`Rental` app and, on the
:guilabel:`Rental Orders` dashboard, click :guilabel:`To Invoice` in the :guilabel:`INVOICE STATUS`
section to view all rental orders that require invoices to be sent.

.. image:: service_products/invoice-status-section.png
   :alt: Sample of the INVOICE STATUS section in the Rental app.

Click on the desired rental order and click :guilabel:`Create Invoice`. Select :guilabel:`Regular
invoice` from the :guilabel:`Create invoice(s)` window and click :guilabel:`Create Draft`.

.. image:: service_products/create-invoices.png
   :alt: Sample of Create invoices window in the Rental app.

If all the details are correct, click :guilabel:`Confirm`. Click :guilabel:`Send` to email the
invoice to the customer or :guilabel:`Print` and then click :guilabel:`Pay` if the customer is in
person.

In the :guilabel:`Pay` pop-up window, select a :guilabel:`Journal` and click :guilabel:`Create
Payment`.

Use the breadcrumbs to return to the rental order.

Pickup products
===============

When time is entered on the :guilabel:`Timesheets` tab of an associated task, the rental order
status automatically changes to :guilabel:`Picked-up`. This happens even if time is entered before
the physical product ordered with the service is picked up.

If a product is rented alongside a service, it is advised to pick it up before entering time on the
associated task. The :guilabel:`Pickup` button is still available on the rental order if time is
entered before picking up the product.

When a customer picks up the product, navigate to the appropriate rental order, click
:guilabel:`Pickup`, and then click :guilabel:`Validate` in the :guilabel:`Validate a pickup` pop-up
form that appears.

.. image:: service_products/pickup-popup.png
   :alt: Sample of a service product pick up pop-up window in the Rental.

Doing so places a :guilabel:`Picked-up` status banner on the rental order.

Return products
===============

Regardless if there is a product rented along with a service, the service or product must be
returned on the rental order.

When a customer returns the products or when the service has been completed, navigate to the
appropriate rental order and click :guilabel:`Return`. Validate the return by clicking
:guilabel:`Validate` in the :guilabel:`Validate a return` pop-up form that appears.

.. image:: service_products/validate-a-return-window.png
   :alt: Sample of returning a service product in the Rental app.

Doing so places a :guilabel:`Returned` status banner on the rental order.

.. example::
   The photography studio had a customer who wanted to rent one of their photographers and banner
   decorations for a home photo shoot. The booking was for two hours.

   On the :guilabel:`Validate a return` form the rental order, the banner line item matches number
   of banners picked up and the photographer line item matches the number of hours submitted on the
   :guilabel:`Timesheets` tab on the related task.

**Odoo Dashboards** allows you to consult, interact with, customize, and build interactive
dashboards that display real-time data from your Odoo database in an easy-to-understand way. By
centralizing data from various Odoo sources in a single location, dashboards provide an overview of
key business metrics that can help you monitor business performance and make informed decisions.

:doc:`Odoo spreadsheets <../../applications/productivity/spreadsheet>` serve as the foundation for
dashboards, with tables and charts used to structure and visualize dynamic Odoo data. :ref:`Data
sources <spreadsheet/insert/data-sources>` connect a dashboard's underlying spreadsheet to your
database, ensuring the most recent data is retrieved every time the dashboard is opened or
refreshed.

With Odoo Dashboards, users can, depending on their :ref:`access rights
<dashboards/access-and-sharing>`:

- :ref:`consult and interact with dashboards <dashboards/use-dashboards>`, including
  :ref:`standard, pre-configured dashboards <dashboards/standard>`
- use :ref:`global filters <dashboards/use-dashboards/global-filters>` to filter all the data shown
  on a dashboard
- :ref:`share a snapshot of a dashboard <dashboards/access-and-sharing>` with internal users who do
  not have the appropriate access rights or with external users
- :doc:`build custom dashboards
  <../../applications/productivity/dashboards/build_and_customize_dashboards>` using Odoo
  Spreadsheet
- :ref:`customize dashboards <build_and_customize_dashboards/customize>` to modify what data is
  shown, the layout, or the filters available
- :ref:`manage access rights <dashboards/access-and-sharing>` to dashboards
- centralize frequently consulted Odoo views in a personal
  :doc:`../../applications/productivity/dashboards/my_dashboard`

.. tip::
   - Once a spreadsheet has been converted into a dashboard, it can only be accessed via the
     Dashboards app.
   - Unlike other Odoo dashboards, :guilabel:`My Dashboard` is not based on Odoo Spreadsheet, but
     rather on :doc:`Odoo views <../studio/views>`.

.. _dashboards/use-dashboards:

Use dashboards
==============

When the Dashboards app is opened, the left panel lists all :ref:`standard, pre-configured
dashboards <dashboards/standard>` and :doc:`custom-built dashboards
<dashboards/build_and_customize_dashboards>` to which a user has been :ref:`granted access
<dashboards/access-and-sharing>`, grouped by section.

Clicking on a dashboard name opens that dashboard in the main view.

.. image:: dashboards/leads-dashboard.png
   :alt: Overview of Leads dashboard

.. tip::
   - Click the :icon:`fa-angle-double-left` :guilabel:`(double chevron)` icon at the top of the
     left panel to collapse the left panel, maximizing the space available for dashboards.
   - Mark a dashboard as a favorite by clicking the :icon:`fa-star` :guilabel:`(Toggle favorite)`
     icon in the upper-right corner. Favorited dashboards are grouped in a :guilabel:`Favorites`
     section at the top of the left panel for easy access.

.. _dashboards/use-dashboards/filter-sort:

Filter and sort data
--------------------

Filtering and sorting allow you to manage what data is displayed and how it is displayed. This can
help tailor the view to answer specific business questions.

- :ref:`Filtering <dashboards/use-dashboards/global-filters>` limits the data presented in charts and
  tables, allowing you to focus only on records that meet specific criteria,  e.g., viewing sales
  data only for a specific sales team.
- :ref:`Sorting <dashboards/use-dashboards/sort>` reorders the data presented in table columns,
  allowing you to see the data from different perspectives, e.g., viewing products by sales revenue
  from highest to lowest.

.. _dashboards/use-dashboards/global-filters:

Apply filters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If :doc:`global filters <spreadsheet/work_with_data/global_filters>` are available for a dashboard,
a search bar above the dashboard allows you to filter the entire dashboard for the selected values.

.. tip::
   - Global filters are available for all :ref:`standard dashboards <dashboards/standard>`.
     Additional :doc:`global filters can be added <spreadsheet/work_with_data/global_filters>` by a
     user with the appropriate :ref:`access rights
     <dashboards/access-and-sharing/customize-configure-build>`.
   - It is also possible to :ref:`search for values <search/values>` by typing directly in the
     search bar; the search categories shown reflect the available global filters.

.. image:: dashboards/global-filters.png
   :alt: Global filters on the Warehouse Daily Operations dashboard
   :scale: 80%

To apply global filters:

#. Click within the search bar or click on the :icon:`fa-caret-down` :guilabel:`(dropdown)` icon to
   access all filters available for that dashboard.
#. For the relevant filter, select a conditional operator from the first dropdown, e.g.,
   :guilabel:`is in`, then select the desired value from the second dropdown.
#. Click :guilabel:`Filter`.

For dashboards with a date filter, this filter can be set via the search bar or via the button
with the :icon:`fa-calendar` :guilabel:`(calendar)` icon.

.. image:: dashboards/global-filters-time.png
   :alt: Filtering a dashboard by date period

.. tip:: The :guilabel:`Custom Range` at the bottom of the period selector shows either a manually
   entered custom range, if relevant, or the start and end date of the selected period.

To remove a value from a filter, click the :icon:`fa-times` :guilabel:`(remove)` icon beside the
name of the value; to empty a filter, click the :icon:`fa-times` :guilabel:`(remove)` icon at the
far right of the filter.

.. _dashboards/use-dashboards/sort:

Sort data
~~~~~~~~~

Depending on the dashboard and the table in question, it may be possible to sort the data by column,
by clicking the column heading. A :icon:`fa-caret-down` :guilabel:`(caret down)` or
:icon:`fa-caret-up` :guilabel:`(caret up)` icon beside a column heading indicates that the column
has been sorted in descending or ascending order, respectively. If, when hovering over other column
headings, a :icon:`fa-sort` :guilabel:`(sort)` icon appears, the column can be sorted.

.. tip::
   If conditional formatting has been applied to a table, the original formatting is maintained when
   the table is resorted by a different column.

   .. example::
      In this example, the table was originally sorted by revenue per CRM tag, in decreasing
      order. Conditional formatting was defined to visualize the proportional revenue using data
      bars. When the table is resorted by number of leads in descending order, the data bars still
      reflect the revenue per tag in decreasing order.

      .. image:: dashboards/sorting-data-bars.png

.. _dashboards/use-dashboards/underlying-data:

Access underlying records
-------------------------

While dashboards provide a user-friendly summary of key data, drilling down to the underlying data
allows a more detailed analysis. This can be useful for investigating anomalies or providing the
full context needed for decision-making.

- **Open underlying database records**: To access database records referenced by a dashboard, click
  on the relevant value in a table or on a data point on a chart. Doing so opens either the
  individual record, or, in the case of charts or tables displaying consolidated data, a list of the
  referenced records.

- **Open underlying database views**: To access the view from which the data for a specific chart
  or table is retrieved, click on the title of the chart or table. Doing so opens the corresponding
  list view, pivot view or graph view.

.. tip::
   To return to a dashboard after drilling down to underlying records or views, click the
   :guilabel:`Dashboards` breadcrumb in the upper-left corner.

.. _dashboards/use-dashboards/charts:

Expand, copy or download charts
-------------------------------

To see charts in full screen, hover over a chart and click the :icon:`fa-expand` icon.

It is also possible to copy or download a chart by hovering over the chart and clicking the
:icon:`fa-ellipsis-v` (vertical ellipsis) icon, then clicking :icon:`os-copy-as-image`
:guilabel:`Copy as image` or :icon:`fa-download` :guilabel:`Download` as relevant.

.. tip::
   :ref:`Expanding a time-series chart to full screen
   <dashboards/use-dashboards/time-series-charts-zoom-scroll>` allows a more detailed analysis.

.. _dashboards/use-dashboards/time-series-charts:

Analyze time-series charts
--------------------------

Time-series charts, i.e., charts showing data over time, can be analyzed more closely by:

- :ref:`adjusting the granularity <dashboards/use-dashboards/time-series-charts-granularity>`;
- :ref:`zooming in <dashboards/use-dashboards/time-series-charts-zoom-scroll>` on a chosen time
  span.

.. _dashboards/use-dashboards/time-series-charts-granularity:

Adjust granularity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For many time-series charts it is possible to adjust the granularity of the unit of time on the
x-axis.

To do so, hover over the chart, click the :icon:`fa-caret-down` :guilabel:`(dropdown)` icon, then
select the desired granularity.

.. image:: dashboards/granularity.png
   :alt: Changing time granularity on a chart's y-axis
   :scale: 80%

.. _dashboards/use-dashboards/time-series-charts-zoom-scroll:

Zoom in on a time span and scroll
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a time-series chart is :ref:`expanded to full screen <dashboards/use-dashboards/charts>`, a
slider below the chart allows you to:

- zoom in on a specific time span by dragging the ends of the slider to select the desired time
  span;
- when you have zoomed in, to scroll through the chart while maintaining the level of zoom by
  dragging the slider to the left or right.

Resize the slider to return to the initial view.

.. example::
   In this example from the :guilabel:`Warehouse Daily Operations` dashboard, the chart shows
   transfers yet to be assigned to a responsible user, by day. The zoom of the chart has been
   adjusted to show data for five days, and the current position of the slider allows data from the
   last five days to be shown.

   .. image:: dashboards/navigate-charts.png
      :alt: Zoomed-in chart with slider

.. _dashboards/standard:

Standard dashboards
===================

Depending on which apps are installed, a series of standard dashboards is available by default.

These pre-configured dashboards have been designed to provide the most relevant insights
for the topic in question, and users with the appropriate :ref:`access rights
<dashboards/access-and-sharing>` can :ref:`consult and interact <dashboards/use-dashboards>` with
them. Dashboard-specific :ref:`filters <dashboards/use-dashboards/global-filters>`, available via
the search bar, allow the entire dashboard to be filtered for selected values.

Standard dashboards can be :ref:`customized <build_and_customize_dashboards/customize>` by a user
with the appropriate :ref:`access rights <dashboards/access-and-sharing/customize-configure-build>`.
For example, dashboard elements like tables and charts, or global filters can be added, edited, or
removed.

.. important::
   When customizing a standard dashboard, it is highly recommended to :ref:`duplicate the dashboard
   <build_and_customize_dashboards/customize/duplicate-dashboard>` and make any changes on the
   duplicated version. Standard dashboards are reinstalled at each Odoo version upgrade, meaning any
   customizations on the original version are lost.

.. _dashboards/configuration:

Configuration settings
======================

.. note::
   Only a user with the appropriate :ref:`access rights <access-rights/groups>` can configure or
   modify settings for dashboards and dashboard sections.

To manage dashboards and dashboard sections, go to :menuselection:`Configuration --> Dashboards`.
The following actions are possible at the level of dashboard sections:

- **Change the order of dashboard sections** by using the :icon:`oi-draggable` :guilabel:`(drag
  handle)` icon to move a section to a new position.

- **Duplicate a dashboard section** by selecting the relevant section name, clicking the
  :icon:`fa-cog` :guilabel:`Actions` button, and then :icon:`fa-clone` :guilabel:`Duplicate`. The
  dashboards within the section are not duplicated.

- **Delete a dashboard section** by selecting the relevant section name, clicking the :icon:`fa-cog`
  :guilabel:`Actions` button then :icon:`fa-trash-o` :guilabel:`Delete`.

   .. tip::
      Standard, pre-installed dashboard sections cannot be deleted; custom dashboard sections, on
      the other hand, can be deleted.

- **Create a new dashboard section** by clicking :guilabel:`New`, then entering the section name.
  When creating a new section, it is possible to add a dashboard to the new section
  directly by clicking :guilabel:`Add a spreadsheet`.

Clicking on an individual dashboard section lists all dashboards within that section. The following
actions are possible:

- **Change the order of a dashboard within its section** by using the :icon:`oi-draggable`
  :guilabel:`(drag handle)` icon to move the dashboard to a new position.

- **Edit the name of a dashboard section or dashboard** by clicking the name and modifying it.

- **Add or remove user groups** to :ref:`control access to the dashboard
  <dashboards/access-and-sharing>`.

- **Select one or more companies** if, in a :doc:`multi-company
  <../../applications/general/companies/multi_company>` database, the dashboard should only be
  visible to users of a specific company or companies. If this field is left blank, the dashboard is
  visible to all users with the appropriate access rights, regardless of which company is currently
  selected in the database.

- **Unpublish a dashboard** by disabling the :guilabel:`Is Published` toggle.

- **Edit the underlying spreadsheet** of a dashboard by clicking :icon:`fa-pencil` :guilabel:`Edit`
  on the line of the relevant dashboard.

  .. important::
     When customizing a standard dashboard, it is highly recommended to :ref:`duplicate the
     dashboard <build_and_customize_dashboards/customize/duplicate-dashboard>` and make any changes
     on the underlying spreadsheet of the duplicated version. Standard dashboards are reinstalled at
     each Odoo version upgrade, meaning any customizations on the original version are lost.

- **Delete a dashboard** by clicking the :icon:`fa-trash` :guilabel:`(trash)` icon.

  .. tip::
     A standard dashboard that is deleted is reinstalled at the next Odoo version upgrade.

- **Add a new dashboard to the section** by clicking :guilabel:`Add a spreadsheet`. Two options
  exist:

  - To convert an existing spreadsheet into a dashboard and add it to the new section, select the
    relevant spreadsheet, then click :guilabel:`Confirm`. Back in the section overview, update the
    :guilabel:`Group` and :guilabel:`Company` fields if needed.

  - To start creating a dashboard from scratch, select :guilabel:`Blank spreadsheet`. To return to
    the section overview, click the name of the section in the top-left corner, above the menu
    bar. Update the :guilabel:`Group` and :guilabel:`Company` fields if needed.

  .. note::
     After a spreadsheet has been converted into a dashboard, it can only be :ref:`accessed and
     edited via the Dashboards app <build_and_customize_dashboards/customize>`.

  .. tip::
     - A newly created dashboard is by default accessible to users belonging to the default internal
       :ref:`user group <access-rights/groups>`. Edit this if needed via the
       :guilabel:`Configuration` settings of the relevant dashboard section.
     - It is also possible to :ref:`convert a spreadsheet into a dashboard
       <spreadsheet/get-started/convert-to-dashboard>` and add it to a dashboard section
       starting from the spreadsheet in the Documents app.

.. _dashboards/access-and-sharing:

Access rights and sharing
=========================

.. _dashboards/access-and-sharing/viewing:

Using dashboards
----------------

The *right to view and interact with a dashboard* is based on :ref:`user groups
<access-rights/groups>`, and is managed in the :ref:`Configuration settings
<dashboards/access-and-sharing/manage-view-access>` of the Dashboards app. Only users who are part
of a group that has been granted access to a specific dashboard see that dashboard in the left-hand
panel when the Dashboards app is opened. Users with `Dashboard / Admin` access rights can view all
dashboards.

However, the *visibility of dynamic Odoo data within a dashboard* is handled separately. This is
based on a user's :ref:`access rights <access-rights/user-permissions>` to the model from which the
data has been retrieved, and takes into account any record rules that may restrict access.

.. important::
   User permissions are taken into account when a user opens a dashboard, with the dashboard only
   being populated with data the user is authorized to see. This means that a user could in theory
   be able to view a dashboard but, due to a lack of appropriate permissions, not be able to see the
   Odoo data the dashboard's creator intended to be displayed.

   Therefore, it is crucial to take user permissions into consideration when granting dashboard
   access to groups.

.. example::
   Granting the user group `Sales / User: Own Documents Only` access to the :guilabel:`Sales`
   dashboard would serve little purpose. While users belonging to that group would be able to view
   and interact with the dashboard, they would only see data related to their own sales, rendering
   the overall dashboard misleading.

.. _dashboards/access-and-sharing/manage-view-access:

Manage access rights to view dashboards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To manage users' rights to view and interact with a dashboard:

#. In the Dashboards app, go to :menuselection:`Configuration --> Dashboards`.
#. From the list of dashboard sections, open the relevant section.
#. On the line of the relevant dashboard, in the :guilabel:`Group` column:

   - add a user group by clicking the field until a dropdown with user groups appears, then
     selecting the appropriate user group. In the dropdown, click :guilabel:`Search More` to access
     the full list of user groups;
   - remove a user group by clicking the relevant group name, then clicking :icon:`fa-times`
     :guilabel:`(Delete)`.

.. _dashboards/access-and-sharing/customize-configure-build:

Building, customizing and configuring dashboards
------------------------------------------------

Only users with `Dashboards / Admin` access rights can :ref:`customize dashboards
<build_and_customize_dashboards/customize>` or :ref:`configure dashboard settings
<dashboards/configuration>`. To :ref:`build a dashboard from scratch
<build_and_customize_dashboards/build>`, a user must have both `Dashboards / Admin` and, at minimum
for the Documents app, `Documents / User` access rights.

.. _dashboards/access-and-sharing/sharing:

Sharing a dashboard snapshot
----------------------------

To share a frozen version of a dashboard with an internal user who does not have the appropriate
access or with an external party, click :icon:`fa-share-alt` :guilabel:`Share` at the top-right of
the page then click the :icon:`fa-clone` :guilabel:`(copy)` icon to copy a shareable link to your
clipboard.

==================================================

==============================
Build and customize dashboards
==============================

In addition to consulting :ref:`standard dashboards <dashboards/standard>`, users
with the appropriate :ref:`access rights <dashboards/access-and-sharing/customize-configure-build>`
can :ref:`build custom dashboards from scratch <build_and_customize_dashboards/build>` or
:ref:`customize existing dashboards <build_and_customize_dashboards/customize>` to respond to
specific business needs.

.. _build_and_customize_dashboards/build:

Build a dashboard
=================

In its most simple terms, building a dashboard involves :doc:`inserting Odoo data into a spreadsheet
<../spreadsheet/insert>` then :ref:`converting that spreadsheet into
a dashboard <spreadsheet/get-started/convert-to-dashboard>`.

However, to build a dashboard that delivers relevant and valuable insights, it is important to
consider the process in terms of three key stages: :ref:`preparation
<build_and_customize_dashboards/build-preparation>`, :ref:`data insertion and manipulation
<build_and_customize_dashboards/build-insertion-manipulation>`, and :ref:`data visualization
<build_and_customize_dashboards/build-visualization>`.

.. _build_and_customize_dashboards/build-preparation:

Preparation
-----------

This stage involves:

- defining the purpose of the dashboard, in other words, the business questions it needs to answer,
  and deciding what data would answer those questions;
- determining where to find the relevant Odoo data and deciding which :doc:`type of view
  <../../studio/views>` (i.e., list, pivot table, or chart) is most suited for the
  data analysis needed;
- preparing the Odoo data by refining the views to focus on the most relevant information, e.g., by
  using :doc:`search filters <../../essentials/search>`, by making only certain list
  fields visible, or by deciding which dimensions and measures a pivot table should use;
- sourcing any other information needed to support the dashboard.

.. _build_and_customize_dashboards/build-insertion-manipulation:

Data insertion and manipulation
-------------------------------

This stage involves:

- :doc:`inserting the prepared lists, pivot tables or charts <../spreadsheet/insert>` into the
  spreadsheet you will use to build your dashboard;
- manipulating the data, if needed, to be able to draw the necessary insights. This may involve
  performing calculations or creating custom metrics using :doc:`standard or Odoo-specific functions
  and formulas <../spreadsheet/work_with_data/functions>`, referencing data from
  various sources within the spreadsheet, or :doc:`converting static pivot tables to dynamic pivot
  tables <../spreadsheet/work_with_data/dynamic_pivot_tables>`.

.. _build_and_customize_dashboards/build-visualization:

Data visualization
------------------

This stage involves:

- presenting the data on at least the first sheet of your spreadsheet (i.e., the sheet that will
  serve as the front end of your dashboard) in a clear, visual, and meaningful way so it is easy to
  interpret. Concretely, this means deciding on the layout and order of elements such as tables and
  charts, as well as using tools and techniques to guide the user, such as clear and descriptive
  headings, text formatting and colors, carefully chosen chart types, and conditional formatting to
  highlight specific data visually;
- :ref:`inserting clickable links <spreadsheet/insert/clickable-links>`, if relevant, to provide
  access to Odoo menu items, URLs, or other sheets within the same spreadsheet if these should also
  be accessible from the front end of your dashboard;
- :doc:`creating global filters <../spreadsheet/work_with_data/global_filters>` to
  allow users to tailor the view to their needs;
- :ref:`converting the spreadsheet into a dashboard
  <spreadsheet/get-started/convert-to-dashboard>`, determining whether to add the dashboard to an
  existing or new dashboard section, and :ref:`managing access rights to the dashboard
  <dashboards/access-and-sharing/manage-view-access>`.

.. tip::
   - Use standard dashboards as inspiration for how to best present and visualize data. For example,
     for charts, :ref:`open the underlying spreadsheet
     <build_and_customize_dashboards/customize/open-spreadsheet>` of a standard dashboard, hover
     over a chart and click the :icon:`fa-bars` :guilabel:`(menu)` icon, then
     :icon:`fa-pencil-square-o` :guilabel:`Edit` to see the chart properties on the right side of
     the screen.
   - The possibility to link to other sheets within the same spreadsheet allows the creation of a
     multi-page dashboard, with users able to navigate between pages thanks to clickable links.
     Global filters apply across all pages of a dashboard.

  `Odoo Tutorial: Dashboard from scratch
  <https://www.odoo.com/slides/slide/dashboard-from-scratch-8957>`_

.. _build_and_customize_dashboards/customize:

Customize a dashboard
=====================

A dashboard can be customized by :ref:`opening its underlying spreadsheet
<build_and_customize_dashboards/customize/open-spreadsheet>`, i.e., the Odoo spreadsheet from which
the dashboard has been created, and :ref:`making any desired changes
<dashboards/customize-dashboard/edit-spreadsheet>`.

.. _build_and_customize_dashboards/customize/open-spreadsheet:

Open the underlying spreadsheet
-------------------------------

.. important::
   When customizing a :ref:`standard dashboard <dashboards/standard>`, it is highly recommended to
   :ref:`duplicate the dashboard <build_and_customize_dashboards/customize/duplicate-dashboard>`
   and make any changes on the underlying spreadsheet of the duplicated version. Standard
   dashboards are reinstalled at each Odoo version upgrade, meaning any customizations on the
   original version are lost.

To open a dashboard's underlying spreadsheet:

#. In the Dashboards app, go to :menuselection:`Configuration --> Dashboards`.
#. Open the relevant dashboard section, then, on the line of the relevant dashboard, click
   :icon:`fa-pencil` :guilabel:`Edit`.

.. tip::
   - To temporarily unpublish a dashboard while you make changes, disable :guilabel:`Is Published`
     *before* editing the dashboard, making note to republish it when the customization has been
     finalized.
   - Users who do not have the appropriate :ref:`access rights
     <dashboards/access-and-sharing/customize-configure-build>` to customize a dashboard can still
     access a read-only version of the dashboard's underlying spreadsheet.
   - With :ref:`developer mode <developer-mode>` activated, click on the :icon:`fa-pencil`
     :guilabel:`(Edit)` icon beside the name of a dashboard in the left panel to open its underlying
     spreadsheet.

The spreadsheet that opens typically consists of at least two sheets:

- **The first sheet** always serves as the front end of your dashboard, and contains the tables
  and charts used to structure and visualize the data.

- **The second and any subsequent sheets** typically contain data used for the calculation of key
  metrics shown on the first sheet.

.. note::
   The :ref:`data sources <spreadsheet/insert/data-sources>` that maintain the connection between
   the spreadsheet and the relevant models in your database can be viewed by clicking
   :menuselection:`Data` on the spreadsheet's menu bar. These data sources are identified by
   their respective :icon:`oi-view-pivot` :guilabel:`(pivot table)`, :icon:`oi-view-list`
   :guilabel:`(list)` or :icon:`fa-bar-chart` :guilabel:`(chart)` icon, followed by their ID and
   name, e.g., :icon:`oi-view-pivot` *(#1) Sales Analysis by Product*.

   For :ref:`standard dashboards <dashboards/standard>`, while the data sources
   are still active and visible in the :menuselection:`Data` menu, the corresponding lists and pivot
   tables have been removed from the spreadsheet for better performance and a neater appearance.

.. _build_and_customize_dashboards/customize/duplicate-dashboard:

Duplicate a dashboard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To duplicate a dashboard:

#. In the Dashboards app, go to :menuselection:`Configuration --> Dashboards`.
#. Open the relevant dashboard section, then, on the line of the dashboard you want to duplicate,
   click :icon:`fa-pencil` :guilabel:`Edit`.
#. In the spreadsheet that opens, click :menuselection:`File -->` :icon:`os-copy-file`
   :menuselection:`Make a copy`.
#. Rename the duplicated dashboard by clicking the name of the spreadsheet at the top left of the
   screen and editing as needed.

.. tip::
   - To return to the overview of the dashboard section, click the name of the original dashboard at
     the top left of the page, then the name of the dashboard section.
   - After duplicating a dashboard, delete the original dashboard by clicking the :icon:`fa-trash`
     :guilabel:`(trash)` icon or rename it by clicking on the name then editing it.

.. _dashboards/customize-dashboard/edit-spreadsheet:

Add, edit, or remove dashboard elements
---------------------------------------

Dashboards can be customized in various ways, such as by:

- adding new tables and charts based on previously inserted or :ref:`newly inserted Odoo data
  <dashboards/customize-dashboard/edit-spreadsheet-new-odoo-data>`. This requires a similar approach
  to :ref:`building a dashboard from scratch <build_and_customize_dashboards/build>`;
- :doc:`adding new global filters <../spreadsheet/work_with_data/global_filters>`
  or editing or deleting existing ones;
- :ref:`adding or editing clickable links <spreadsheet/insert/clickable-links>` to Odoo menus, URLs,
  or to other sheets within the same spreadsheet.

.. tip::
   - The first tab of the spreadsheet serves as the front end of the dashboard. Any tables or charts
     that should be visible on the final dashboard need to be added to this sheet.
   - Dashboard elements that are no longer needed can be deleted from the spreadsheet. If, after
     deleting a dashboard element, a :ref:`data source <spreadsheet/insert/data-sources>` is no
     longer being used in the spreadsheet, this is indicated by a :icon:`fa-exclamation-triangle`
     :guilabel:`(warning)` icon in the :guilabel:`Data` menu.

   .. image:: build_and_customize_dashboards/list-deleted.png
      :alt: Warning to indicate data source no longer used in spreadsheet

.. _dashboards/customize-dashboard/edit-spreadsheet-new-odoo-data:

Insert new Odoo data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New Odoo data, such as lists, pivot tables, or charts, can be inserted into a dashboard, starting
from the relevant list view, pivot view, or graph view. Concretely, a list or pivot table is
inserted into a new sheet in the dashboard's underlying spreadsheet; a chart is inserted on the
first sheet of the spreadsheet.

To insert new data:

#. With the relevant list view, pivot view or graph view open in your database, proceed as follows:

   - For a list view, click the :icon:`fa-cog` :guilabel:`(Actions)` icon beside the name of the
     view, then :guilabel:`Spreadsheet -->` :icon:`oi-view-list` :menuselection:`Insert list in
     spreadsheet`.
   - For a pivot or graph view, click :guilabel:`Insert in Spreadsheet` at the top left of the view.

#. In the window that opens, edit the name if needed. For a list, edit the number of records, i.e.,
   rows to be inserted, if needed.
#. Click the :guilabel:`Dashboards` tab then select in which dashboard the list, pivot table, or
   chart should be inserted.

The dashboard's underlying spreadsheet opens, with the new data inserted either on a new sheet (list
or pivot table) or on the first sheet (chart).

My Dashboard
============

**My Dashboard** allows you to centralize the :doc:`Odoo views <../../studio/views>` you consult
most regularly, making it possible to see critical tasks at a glance without having to first
navigate through multiple apps.

My Dashboard is empty until at least one view has been added.

   .. image:: my_dashboard/my-dashboard.png
      :alt: Example of views added to My Dashboard

Views inserted in My Dashboard are fully dynamic and retain many features of the source view, e.g.,
sorting of lists, changing the measures used for a pivot table or cohort view, changing the chart
type, or clicking on a value or data point to view the underlying record(s).

.. tip::
   - It is not possible to change the domain, i.e., the :doc:`filtering or grouping
     <../../essentials/search>`, of a view that has been added to My Dashboard. To change the
     domain, make the necessary changes in the original view, then re-insert the view in My
     Dashboard and delete the originally inserted view.
   - Unlike other Odoo dashboards, My Dashboard is not based on **Odoo Spreadsheet**.

.. _dashboards/my-dashboard/add-views:

Add views
=========

Most Odoo views can be added to My Dashboard, including:

- :ref:`multiple record views <studio/views/multiple-records>` like list, kanban, and map
- :ref:`timeline views <studio/views/timeline>` like calendar, cohort, and gantt
- :ref:`reporting views <studio/views/reporting>` like pivot and graph

To add a view to My Dashboard:

#. With the relevant view open in your database, click the :icon:`fa-cog` :guilabel:`(Actions)` icon
   beside the name of the view, then :menuselection:`Dashboard`.
#. Under :guilabel:`Add to my Dashboard`, rename the view if desired, then click :guilabel:`Add`.

      :scale: 80%

#. Refresh the page.

The added view is now visible as a widget in My Dashboard in the Dashboards app.

.. tip::
   If added views are not showing in My Dashboard, refresh the browser page.

.. _dashboards/my-dashboard/layout:

Customize layout
================

When at least one view has been added to My Dashboard, the page can be customized as follows:

- **Change the layout of the page**: Click :guilabel:`Change Layout` in the top-right corner and
  select the desired layout.

  .. tip::
     For multi-column layouts, the column limits are identified by :icon:`fa-caret-left`
     :guilabel:`(left caret)` and :icon:`fa-caret-right` :guilabel:`(right caret)` icons at the
     bottom of the page. If needed, scroll to the bottom of the page to see the column limits.

     .. image:: my_dashboard/column-limits.png
        :alt: Column limits visible at bottom of page

- **Collapse and expand widgets**: By default, an inserted widget is shown fully expanded. To
  collapse, or minimize, a widget, and show only the title, click the :icon:`fa-window-minimize`
  :guilabel:`(minimize)` icon at the top right of the widget. To expand a widget, click the
  :icon:`fa-window-maximize` :guilabel:`(maximize)` icon.
- **Move widgets**: Drag and drop widgets to the desired location in the same column or a different
  column.
- **Remove widgets**: To remove a widget from the page, click the :icon:`fa-times`
  :guilabel:`(remove)` icon.

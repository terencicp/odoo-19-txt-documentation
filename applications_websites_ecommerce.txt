      :icon:`fa-exchange` (:guilabel:`Compare`) button, and choose between :guilabel:`Inline` and
      :guilabel:`On Hover`.

.. note::
   You can only compare a maximum of four products at a time.

.. tip::
   Define :ref:`attribute categories <ecommerce/categories_variants/attribute-categories>` to group
   similar attributes under the same section when comparing products.

.. _ecommerce/products/additional_features/wishlists:

Wishlist
========

The :icon:`fa-heart-o` (:guilabel:`Add to wishlist`) button allows customers to add products
to their wishlist, i.e., save them for later. It is enabled by default and available on each
product page.

This button can be enabled independently in different sections of the website:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Product page

      Go to a product page, open the website editor, go to the :guilabel:`Style` tab, navigate to
      the :guilabel:`Products Details` section, and toggle the :icon:`fa-heart`
      :guilabel:`Wishlist` button. Once done, it becomes available on each product page.

      editor, click the header, navigate to the :guilabel:`Show/Hide Elements` section, and toggle
      the :icon:`fa-heart` (:guilabel:`Wishlist`) icon next to :guilabel:`Show Empty`. If it is not
      enabled, the wishlist icon only appears when an item has been added to the wishlist. The
      number of items in the wishlist is also displayed next to the icon.

Wishlist page
-------------

It is possible to customize the layout of the :guilabel:`My Wishlist` page. To do so, open
the website editor while on the wishlist page, and in the :guilabel:`Style` tab under the
:guilabel:`Wishlist Page` section, choose a :guilabel:`Products Design`. Depending on the selected
design, adapt the layout according to :guilabel:`Desktop` or :guilabel:`Mobile` devices.
Click the :icon:`fa-paint-brush` (:guilabel:`paint brush`) icon next to :guilabel:`Products Design`
to access more customization options.

.. tip::
   - Customers can move products from their cart to their wishlist by clicking the :guilabel:`Save

   - On the :guilabel:`My Wishlist` page, customers can move products from their wishlist to the
     cart.

.. _ecommerce/products/additional_features/product-highlight:

Product highlight
=================

The eCommerce app allows you to highlight products to increase their visibility. To do so, go to
:menuselection:`Website --> eCommerce --> Product Ribbons`. You can either use one of the
preconfigured ribbons (:guilabel:`Sold out`, :guilabel:`Sale`, :guilabel:`Out of stock` or
:guilabel:`New!`) or create a :guilabel:`New` one. Add a ribbon name, and select the method to
:guilabel:`Assign` it:

- :guilabel:`Manually`: assign the ribbon manually.
- :guilabel:`On Sale`: the ribbon is displayed when the product is on sale, e.g., when using a
  :ref:`comparison price <ecommerce/prices/permanent-discounts>`.
- :guilabel:`When New`: the ribbon is displayed when a new product is added. Specify the number of
  :guilabel:`days after publication` it should be displayed.
- :guilabel:`when out of stock`: the ribbon is displayed when the product is currently no longer
  available.

Choose its :guilabel:`Position`, either :guilabel:`Left` or :guilabel:`Right`, and a
:guilabel:`Style`, either :guilabel:`Ribbon` or :guilabel:`Badge`. Define the :guilabel:`Text Color`
and the :guilabel:`Background Color`. Then :guilabel:`Save`. The ribbon is now available for all
the e-commerce products.

.. image:: additional_features/badge-applied.png
   :alt: Product with badge

.. tip::
   - There are other ways to create a new product ribbon:

     - Access the product form, and under the :guilabel:`Sales` tab, change or create the ribbon in
       the :guilabel:`Ribbon` field.
     - Edit/create ribbons from the :doc:`website editor <../../website/web_design>`.
       To do so, go to the :guilabel:`Style` tab, and navigate to the :guilabel:`Product Details`
       section. Click the green :icon:`fa-plus` (:guilabel:`Create`) icon next to the
       :guilabel:`Ribbon` field or the :icon:`fa-pencil-square-o` (:guilabel:`Edit`) icon next to
       the :guilabel:`Ribbon` label. The :guilabel:`Assign` feature is not available for
       configuration in the website editor.

       .. image:: additional_features/create-new-ribbon.png
          :alt: Create a new ribbon in the website editor

   - It is also possible to add ribbons for specific :ref:`product variants
     <ecommerce/categories_variants/product-variants>`. To do so, go to :menuselection:`Website -->
     eCommerce --> Products` and select a product. Click the :guilabel:`Variants` smart button,
     choose a variant, and add a ribbon in the :guilabel:`Variant Ribbon` field of the
     :guilabel:`Sales` section.


==================================================
SECTION: b2b_b2c.rst
PATH: applications/websites/ecommerce/b2b_b2c.rst
==================================================

===========
B2B and B2C
===========

Odoo eCommerce is designed to fulfill the needs of both B2B and B2C companies. It allows you to
configure :doc:`prices <products/prices>`, manage :doc:`access <customer_accounts>` for specific
customers, and :ref:`customize the website <ecommerce/b2b_b2c/multiple-websites>` to support B2B,
B2C, or both business models.

.. _ecommerce/b2b_b2c/prices:

Prices
======

While B2C businesses sell directly to the end consumer with a :ref:`tax-included
<ecommerce-price-management-tax-display>` price, B2B businesses usually :ref:`exclude taxes
<ecommerce-price-management-tax-display>` and may even prefer to hide prices altogether, showcasing
only their products instead.
To configure a B2B-specific online shop, make sure the :ref:`Tax-Excluded
<ecommerce/prices/taxes>` option is enabled, and complete the configuration to :ref:`hide the
pricing <ecommerce/prices/hide-prices>`.

.. tip::
   To make sure that only customers with an :ref:`account and granted access
   <ecommerce/customer_accounts/account-creation>` can see the prices, go to
   :menuselection:`Website --> eCommerce --> Customers`, click the :icon:`fa-caret-down`
   :guilabel:`(dropdown)` icon from the search bar, and select the :guilabel:`Archived` filter.
   Then click the :guilabel:`Public user` card, go to the :guilabel:`Sales & Purchase` tab, and
   add the zero-priced pricelist configured to :ref:`cover all countries
   <ecommerce/prices/country-groups>`. Keep the :guilabel:`Public User` contact :guilabel:`Archived`
   at all times. Website visitors now see the products without prices, while only customers with an
   :ref:`account invitation <ecommerce/customer_accounts/account-creation>` and an assigned
   :ref:`pricelist <ecommerce/prices/pricelists>` can view the pricing in the customer portal.

.. seealso::
   - :doc:`/applications/finance/accounting/taxes/B2B_B2C`
   - :ref:`Discounts <ecommerce/prices/discounts>`

Access request
==============

When running a B2B business, you usually :ref:`hide the pricing <ecommerce/b2b_b2c/prices>` on the
web shop and make it available for :ref:`logged-in users <ecommerce/customer_accounts/shop-access>`
only. To prevent anyone from signing up freely, set the :ref:`Customer Account
<ecommerce/customer_accounts/account-creation>` setting option to :guilabel:`On invitation`.
To create a page where customers request access, open the :doc:`website editor
<../website/web_design>`, :ref:`create a form <website/building_blocks/form>`, customize it, and in
the :guilabel:`Action` field, select :guilabel:`Create a customer`.

.. tip::
   You can assign tags created on a contact form under :menuselection:`Website --> Configuration
   --> Customers` to identify what kind of customers have submitted the form. To do so, select
   a field in the form while in :guilabel:`Edit` mode, click the :guilabel:`+ Field` button under
   the :guilabel:`Customize` tab, and set the field's :guilabel:`Type` to :guilabel:`Tags`.
   Toggle the tags that should be automatically assigned when a customer fills in the form and set
   the field's :guilabel:`Visibility` to :guilabel:`Hidden`.

When a customer submits the form, a new contact is automatically created in the database. The
contact is assigned the first pricelist from the list of available pricelists, and, if applicable,
the specified tags.

Submitted requests can be found under the :menuselection:`Website --> eCommerce --> Customers`.
Select the customer you want to :ref:`grant portal access
<ecommerce/customer_accounts/grant-access>` to. Once done, the selected customer is able to
view the B2B prices and products. Make sure the correct pricelist is assigned to their
contact form.

.. tip::
   - It is also possible to hide the entire shop from the public using the :ref:`Ecommerce Access
     <ecommerce/customer_accounts/shop-access>` setting and only make it available for logged-in
     customers.
   - Configure the :ref:`checkout policy <ecommerce/customer_accounts/checkout-access>` to
     allow/disallow guest checkout for B2C businesses.
   - Enable the :ref:`Shared Customer Accounts <ecommerce/customer_accounts/multiple-websites>`
     feature to allow customers to use the same account on :ref:`all
     <ecommerce/b2b_b2c/multiple-websites>` your websites.

.. seealso::
   :doc:`customer_accounts`

.. _ecommerce/b2b_b2c/multiple-websites:

Multiple websites
=================

Settings are website-specific, which means it is possible to configure different behaviors for
each website. For example, you can set up a B2C website that allows :ref:`guest checkout
<ecommerce/customer_accounts/checkout-access>` and displays :ref:`tax-included prices
<ecommerce-price-management-tax-display>`, and a B2B website that requires :ref:`sign-in
<ecommerce/customer_accounts/checkout-access>` and shows :ref:`tax-excluded prices
<ecommerce-price-management-tax-display>`. However, each :ref:`pricelist
<ecommerce/prices/pricelists>` can only be assigned to one website at a time. If you want to use
the same pricelist on several websites, duplicate the pricelist and assign each copy to its
corresponding website.

.. tip::
   If you are running a B2B and B2C business, we *strongly* recommend to create two :doc:`separate
   websites <../website/configuration/multi_website>` and assign a :ref:`zero-priced pricelist
   <ecommerce/b2b_b2c/prices>` to the B2B website and a regular pricelist to the B2C website.
   In case, you prefer using a single website, configure it using :ref:`country groups
   <ecommerce/prices/country-groups>` and assigning :ref:`pricelists <ecommerce/prices/pricelists>`
   to customers, and deactivate the :ref:`Selectable <ecommerce/prices/selectable-pricelists>`
   option.

Additional features
===================

Invoice
-------

Depending on the type of business (B2B or B2C), you might want to issue an invoice. An invoice can
either be generated automatically (for B2B) or on demand of the customer (for B2C). This process
can be automated if (and when) the online payment is :ref:`confirmed <handling/sales>`.
To automate invoicing, enable the :ref:`Automatic Invoice <handling/legal>` setting. If this
feature has not been enabled, the customer only receives an order confirmation.

.. _ecommerce/b2b_b2c/b2b-fields:

B2B fields at checkout
----------------------

On the :guilabel:`Order summary` page, open the :doc:`website editor <../website/web_design>`, go to
the :guilabel:`Style` tab, and toggle the :guilabel:`Show B2B Fields` switch to display B2B-specific
additional fields like :guilabel:`VAT` or :guilabel:`Company Name` during the :ref:`delivery
<ecommerce/checkout/delivery>` step.


==================================================
SECTION: catalog.rst
PATH: applications/websites/ecommerce/products/catalog.rst
==================================================

===============
Product catalog
===============

The e-commerce catalog displays products for customers to browse. It is organized using :ref:`product
categories <ecommerce/categories_variants/categories>`, available :ref:`product variants
<ecommerce/categories_variants/product-variants>`, sorting options, and navigation paths.
Essentially, the e-commerce catalog is the shop page of your website.

The product catalog features a :ref:`toolbar and some filters <ecommerce/catalog/toolbar-and-filters>`
in the sidebar (or slide-out menu), along with a dedicated :ref:`product listing area
<ecommerce/catalog/product-listing>`. Additionally, the shop and category pages' :ref:`layout
<ecommerce/catalog/customize-layout>`, as well as the :ref:`e-commerce footer
<ecommerce/catalog/footer>`, can be customized, and you can add :ref:`building blocks
<ecommerce/catalog/catalog-blocks>` as needed.

To customize the catalog, go to the shop page, click :guilabel:`Edit` in the upper-right corner,
select the section you want to change, and navigate to the :guilabel:`Style` tab.

.. _ecommerce/catalog/toolbar-and-filters:

Toolbar and filters
===================

The toolbar and sidebar (or slide-out menu) provide advanced filtering tools to help customers
search and navigate the product catalog using :ref:`categories <ecommerce/catalog/categories>` and
:ref:`attributes <ecommerce/catalog/attributes>`.

.. tip::
   If you do not want to display a toolbar or sidebar, disable all related options in the website
   editor, :ref:`hide attributes <ecommerce/categories_variants/attributes>`, and make sure to only
   assign one pricelist to the website.

.. _ecommerce/catalog/categories:

Categories
----------

To create a :ref:`category <ecommerce/categories_variants/categories>` quick access in the toolbar
or general access in the sidebar, click the :guilabel:`Top` and/or :guilabel:`Sidebar` button next
to :guilabel:`Categories`, and choose a :guilabel:`Style` for them. When the :guilabel:`Sidebar` is
selected, the option :guilabel:`Collapse Category Recursive` appears, allowing you to collapse the
category in the sidebar.

.. image:: catalog/category-quick-access-top.png
   :alt: Category quick access in the toolbar.

.. note::
   The category filters located in the sidebar are not affected by the :guilabel:`Filters` setting.

.. _ecommerce/catalog/toolbar:

Toolbar
-------

It is possible to display a search bar or sort-by options in the toolbar of the shop page by
clicking the :guilabel:`Sort By` and/or :guilabel:`Search` buttons next to the :guilabel:`Toolbar`
label. Toggle the :guilabel:`Floating` switch on to always display the search bar, the
:ref:`pricelist selector <ecommerce/prices/pricelists>` (if any), and sort-by options at the bottom
of the window, even when scrolling, and select a :guilabel:`Default Sort` option.

.. note::
   The default sort applies to *all* :ref:`categories <ecommerce/categories_variants/categories>`.


.. _ecommerce/catalog/filters:

Filters
-------

Set the :guilabel:`Filters` field to:

- :guilabel:`Sidebar`: to display filters in the side panel;
- :guilabel:`Off-screen menu`: to display filters in a slide-out menu that opens when clicking
  the :icon:`fa-sliders` :guilabel:`Filters` button in the toolbar;
- :guilabel:`Hide`: to hide filters entirely.

By default, two :guilabel:`Filters` are enabled:

  - :guilabel:`Price`: Use the switch to display a :guilabel:`Price Range` bar, which
    allows customers to filter products according to a specific price range by dragging adjustable
    handles.
  - :guilabel:`Tags`: Toggle the switch to display product :guilabel:`Tags` on the shop page, and
    allow customers to filter products using those tags by going to the
    :guilabel:`Tags` section.

    .. tip::
       To create product tags on your e-commerce, go to :menuselection:`Website --> eCommerce
       --> Product Tags`, and click :guilabel:`New`. Add a :guilabel:`Tag` name, toggle the
       :guilabel:`Visible to customers` switch, and select a :guilabel:`Color`. Optionally, add an
       image. Then go to the product form, and assign the relevant tags where needed.

For :doc:`rental products <../../../sales/rental>`, you can also add a :guilabel:`Rental Date`
option to display a date range calendar to check their availability over a specific period.

.. _ecommerce/catalog/attributes:

Attributes
~~~~~~~~~~

When you offer :ref:`product variants <ecommerce/categories_variants/product-variants>` with
different :ref:`attributes <ecommerce/categories_variants/attributes>`, those options appear
in the sidebar or slide-out menu when filters are shown. The menu automatically adapts to the
number of attribute sections:

- **Up to 4 attributes**: all the attribute values are displayed.
- **More than 4 attributes**: the sections are automatically collapsed.


.. note::
   - For :guilabel:`Radio` and :guilabel:`Select` :ref:`display types
     <products/variants/attributes>`, a :guilabel:`View More` button appears when there are more
     than **8** values, and a search field when the number of values exceeds **20**.
   - At least two attribute values are required for the filter to be visible.
   - The attribute filters located in the sidebar or slide-out menu are affected by the
     :guilabel:`Filters` setting.

.. seealso::
   - :doc:`../../../sales/sales/products_prices/products/variants`
   - :doc:`categories_variants`

.. _ecommerce/catalog/product-listing:

Product listing area
====================

.. _ecommerce/catalog/layout:

Define the number of products to display on your shop pages by configuring the :guilabel:`Size`
displayed per page and line, and specify the number of columns for :guilabel:`Mobile` devices.

.. note::
   The number of products displayed on a page may affect performance and page loading speed.

In addition, you can manually change a product’s position on the shop page or product category page.
To do so, click a specific product, change its :guilabel:`Size`, and :guilabel:`Re-order` it using
the arrows in the :guilabel:`Product` section of the :guilabel:`Style` tab. The
:icon:`fa-angle-double-left` (:guilabel:`double left arrow`) and :icon:`fa-angle-double-right`
(:guilabel:`double right arrow`) buttons allow you to move the product to the extreme left or right,
and the :icon:`fa-angle-left` (:guilabel:`single left arrow`) and :icon:`fa-angle-right`
(:guilabel:`single right arrow`) buttons allow you to move it one row to the left or right. You can
also choose or create a :ref:`ribbon or badge
<ecommerce/products/additional_features/product-highlight>` to highlight a specific product.

.. tip::
   It is also possible to change the products' positions on the shop page by going to
   :menuselection:`Website --> eCommerce --> Products`, switching to the list view, and
   dragging and dropping the products within the list.

.. _ecommerce/catalog/products-design:

Product card design
-------------------

To customize the product cards' design, choose a :guilabel:`Products Design`, click the
:icon:`fa-paint-brush` :guilabel:`(paint brush)` icon next to it to:

- Choose a :guilabel:`Preset` layout;
- Adapt the :guilabel:`General` design;
- Customize the :guilabel:`Text & content` (e.g., show a :guilabel:`Description`, and
  :guilabel:`Ratings`);
- Customize the :guilabel:`Images`' layout (e.g., enable :guilabel:`Secondary
  Image` to show a second image when hovering over the product image on the shop or category page);
- Enable some :guilabel:`Actions` (e.g., :icon:`fa-shopping-cart`
  :ref:`Add to cart <ecommerce/checkout/add-to-cart>`, :icon:`fa-exchange` :ref:`Compare
  <ecommerce/products/additional_features/product-comparison>`, or :icon:`fa-heart` :ref:`Wishlist
  <ecommerce/products/additional_features/wishlists>`) and customize their placement.

.. tip::
   You can also add a :ref:`variant picture <ecommerce/categories_variants/attributes>` on the
   product card and product page.

.. _ecommerce/catalog/customize-layout:

Shop and category page design
=============================

The design of the shop and individual category pages can be customized as follows:

- Choose whether the :guilabel:`Content Width` of the shop and category pages should be
  :guilabel:`Regular` or :guilabel:`Full` width.
- Define the headers: navigate to the relevant page, then change the header directly on the page
  if needed. Toggle the :guilabel:`Show Title` and/or the :guilabel:`Center Content` switches. For
  product category pages, toggle the :guilabel:`Show Description` switch to show the :ref:`category
  description <ecommerce/categories_variants/categories>`.
- Use :doc:`building blocks <../../website/web_design/building_blocks>` to add content in the
  top/bottom section of the page, either for the entire shop page or for a specific category. In
  the latter case, the block appears *only* when filtering by that category. To do so, move the
  block to the far top or bottom section to display it on the general shop page or to the area
  below the category's name at the top or beneath the product list to display it only when filtering
  by that specific category.

  .. image:: catalog/catalog-header-footer.png
     :alt: Place building block in the header or footer.

  .. tip::
     - Adding content to an e-commerce category page helps improve the :doc:`SEO
       <../../website/structure/seo>` strategy. Using keywords linked to the products or the
       e-commerce categories can also increase organic traffic. Additionally, each category has its
       own specific URL that can be pointed to and is indexed by search engines.
     - E-commerce categories can also be added as :ref:`mega menu items
       <website/header_footer/mega-menus>` for quick access.
     - It is also possible to customize individual :ref:`product pages
       <ecommerce/products/product-form>`.

.. _ecommerce/catalog/catalog-blocks:

Catalog blocks
==============

The :guilabel:`Catalog` :doc:`building blocks
</applications/websites/website/web_design/building_blocks>` can be used, for example, to create
quick access to the shop page, showcase specific product categories, highlight a specific product
selection, or add a banner with general information or promotions.

Depending on the selected template, you can :ref:`customize <website/building_blocks/edit>` the
blocks in the :guilabel:`Style` tab.

.. example::
   .. image:: catalog/catalog-products-block.png
      :alt: Example of a catalog block for specific products

   For example, this specific :guilabel:`Catalog` block template displays a selection of
   products and can be customized to:

   - Adapt the block's design.
   - Select a :guilabel:`Cards Design`, and :ref:`configure <ecommerce/catalog/products-design>` it
     using the :icon:`fa-paint-brush` :guilabel:`(paint brush)` icon.
   - Define which items are shown in the block by selecting the relevant :guilabel:`Filter` option,
     e.g., :guilabel:`Newest Products` to show the latest arrivals.
   - Select a specific product category in the :guilabel:`Category` dropdown list.
   - Filter products by toggling the :guilabel:`Tags` and/or :guilabel:`Show variants` options.

.. _ecommerce/catalog/footer:

E-commerce-specific website footer
==================================

The :ref:`website footer <website/header_footer/footer-design>` can also be configured to use
the e-commerce-specific template. Then, add the relevant :ref:`links <website/elements/links>`, and
adapt the footer's text and layout as needed in the website editor. The :doc:`available payment
methods </applications/finance/payment_providers>` are also shown in this footer. To adapt their
display, go to the :guilabel:`Supported Payment Methods` section in the website editor.

.. note::
   It is not possible to create a customized footer per category.

product options to customers while organizing products by category for a better overview and
smoother navigation.

.. _ecommerce/categories_variants/product-variants:

Product variants
================

:doc:`Product variants </applications/sales/sales/products_prices/products/variants>` are different
versions of the same product, created by combining :ref:`attributes <products/variants/attributes>`
like color, size, material, etc., which can lead to differences in price and/or availability.

To configure product variants for a product:

#. Go to :menuselection:`Website --> Configuration --> Settings`.
#. Scroll down to the :guilabel:`eCommerce` section and enable the
   :guilabel:`Product Variants` feature.
#. Access the :ref:`product form <ecommerce/products/product-form>` and go to the
   :guilabel:`Attributes & Variants` tab.
#. Click :guilabel:`Add a line` and select the relevant attribute and its values. Repeat this step
   for each additional attribute.

The product variants are created automatically (or not) based on the :ref:`attribute's
configuration <products/variants/attributes>`.

.. _ecommerce/categories_variants/attributes:

Attributes
----------

Attributes refer to the characteristics of a product, such as its color or material. Each attribute
includes a set of values.

.. image:: categories_variants/attributes-values.png
   :alt: Attributes and variants of your product

Once your attributes are :ref:`created <products/variants/attributes>`, set the following options
on the attribute form to control where and/or how they appear on the website:

- :guilabel:`eCommerce Filter`: Set the field to :guilabel:`Visible` to make the attribute
  available in the shop's filter section.
- :guilabel:`On Product Cards`: Set the field to :guilabel:`Visible` or :guilabel:`Hover` to display
  attributes on the product card on the shop page. These options are only available when
  :ref:`variants are created instantly for the attribute <products/variants/attributes>`.

When the field is set to :guilabel:`Visible`, the :guilabel:`Show Thumbnails` option can be toggled
to show a product variant image instead of the attribute values.

It is also possible to add a variant picture on the product card on the shop page. To do so, go to
the product form, click the :icon:`fa-sitemap` :guilabel:`Variants` :ref:`smart button
<products/variants/variants-smart-button>`, select a variant, and click the :icon:`fa-pencil`
:guilabel:`(Edit)` icon to add a picture for each variant. Make sure that the :ref:`Show Thumbnails
<ecommerce/categories_variants/attributes>` option is enabled on the attribute form.

Attribute categories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To group similar attributes under the same section when :ref:`comparing products
<ecommerce/products/additional_features/product-comparison>`, select the relevant
:guilabel:`eCommerce Category` or create a new one. Click the :icon:`fa-arrow-right`
:guilabel:`(internal link)` icon next to the category name to:

- Rename the category.
- Change its :guilabel:`Sequence`.
- Reorder the :guilabel:`Related Attributes` to define the order in which they are displayed in
  the comparison summary.
- Add attributes to the category by clicking :guilabel:`Add a line`.

.. _ecommerce/categories_variants/categories:

E-commerce categories
=====================

E-commerce categories are used to organize products into groups, making it easier for customers
to browse the online store.

.. image:: catalog/category-quick-access-top.png
   :alt: Category quick access in the toolbar.

To create e-commerce categories, go to :menuselection:`Website --> eCommerce -->
eCommerce Categories`, and click :guilabel:`New`. On the category form, add a
:guilabel:`Name`, optionally enter a :guilabel:`Parent` category, restrict it to a specific
:guilabel:`Website`, and write a :guilabel:`Description`, if needed. You can also add a
:guilabel:`Cover Image` for the category.

To use :guilabel:`eCommerce categories`, go to :menuselection:`Website --> eCommerce --> Products`,
select the product you wish to modify, go to the :guilabel:`Sales` tab, navigate to the
:guilabel:`Ecommerce shop` section, and select the :guilabel:`Categories` it belongs to.

.. note::
   - A single product can belong to multiple e-commerce categories.
   - Define how to :ref:`display categories <ecommerce/catalog/categories>` on the shop page.

Ordering and checkout
=====================

Odoo eCommerce provides several options to organize the ordering and checkout process. It offers
different :ref:`order button <ecommerce/checkout/order-buttons>` options and sequential
:ref:`checkout steps <ecommerce/checkout/steps>`, some of which support additional features. The
related buttons and checkout pages can be customized using the :doc:`website editor
<../website/web_design>`.

.. _ecommerce/checkout/order-buttons:

Order buttons
=============

To customize the ordering process in Odoo eCommerce, you can:

- change the :ref:`Add to Cart <ecommerce/checkout/add-to-cart>` button's behavior;
- replace it with a :ref:`customized <ecommerce/checkout/prevent-sale>` button;
- add a :ref:`Buy now <ecommerce/checkout/buy-now>` button.

.. _ecommerce/checkout/add-to-cart:

Add to cart options
-------------------

Default add to cart behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When clicking the :guilabel:`Add to cart` button, different actions can be triggered. To configure
them, go to :menuselection:`Website --> Configuration --> Settings`, scroll down to the
:guilabel:`eCommerce` section, and select one of the following options for the :guilabel:`Add to
cart` feature:

- :guilabel:`Stay on Product Page`: The customer can choose if they want to :guilabel:`Add to cart`
  and continue shopping or :guilabel:`Go to the Checkout`.
- :guilabel:`Go to cart`: The customer is immediately redirected to the cart.

.. _ecommerce/checkout/prevent-sale:

Button customization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can replace the :guilabel:`Add to Cart` button with a :guilabel:`Contact Us` button, which
redirects users to the default contact form.

.. note::
   Removing the ability to add products to the cart is often used by businesses that want to display
   an online catalog but cannot share prices publicly (e.g., to offer custom or variable pricing).

To display the :guilabel:`Contact Us` button and a note saying `Not Available For Sale` , you need
to :ref:`hide your prices <ecommerce/prices/hide-prices>` on your product page.

.. image:: checkout/cart-contact-us.png
   :alt: Contact us button on product page

.. note::
   The :guilabel:`Contact Us` button label, URL, and the *Not Available For Sale* text beneath the
   product title and description can be modified on the product's page while in :guilabel:`Edit`
   mode.

Additional add to cart buttons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can add additional :guilabel:`Add to Cart` buttons and link them to specific products on any
website page.

To add them, open the website editor and place the :guilabel:`Add to Cart Button` inner content
building block. Once placed, click the button, scroll to the :guilabel:`Add to Cart Button` section,
and configure the following:

- :guilabel:`Product`: Select the product to link the button with.
- :guilabel:`Action`: Choose if it should be an :guilabel:`Add to Cart` or :ref:`Buy Now
  <ecommerce/checkout/buy-now>` button.

.. note::
   - If the product has variants, either choose one or leave the option on :guilabel:`Visitor's
     Choice`, which prompts the customer to select a variant and then :guilabel:`Add to Cart` and
     continue shopping or :guilabel:`Go to Checkout`.
   - The default :guilabel:`Add to Cart` button does not offer those options, but its label can be
     changed.

.. tip::
   In the website editor, it is also possible to show or hide the :icon:`fa-shopping-cart`
   (:guilabel:`cart`) icon in the page's header. Click the header and then the
   :icon:`fa-shopping-cart` (:guilabel:`cart`) button next to the :guilabel:`Show Empty` option
   under the :guilabel:`Style` tab.

.. _ecommerce/checkout/buy-now:

Buy now
-------

To let customers choose to go to the :ref:`Order summary <ecommerce/checkout/review_order>` step
directly, you can add an additional :guilabel:`Buy now` button. To do so, go to any product's page,
open the website editor, go to the :guilabel:`Style` tab, and click the :icon:`fa-bolt`
:guilabel:`Buy Now` button next to the :guilabel:`Purchase Options`.

.. image:: checkout/cart-buy-now.png
   :alt: Buy now button

.. _ecommerce/checkout/reorder:

Reorder products
----------------

Customers can reorder items from a previous sales order:

- from their customer portal, using the :guilabel:`Order Again` button. All products from the
  selected order are automatically added to the cart, and customers can then :guilabel:`Remove` any
  items they don't want to reorder.

  .. image:: checkout/order-again-button.png
     :alt: Reorder button

- from the cart, by clicking :guilabel:`Quick reorder` at the :ref:`Order summary step
  <ecommerce/checkout/review_order>`. Customers can then adjust quantities as needed and click the
  :icon:`fa-cart-plus` :guilabel:`(cart)` button next to the product(s) they want to reorder.

  .. image:: checkout/cart-quick-reorder.png
     :alt: Quick reorder button

.. _ecommerce/checkout/steps:

Checkout steps
==============

During the checkout process, customers are taken through the following steps:

- :ref:`Order summary <ecommerce/checkout/review_order>`
- :ref:`Address and delivery <ecommerce/checkout/delivery>`
- :ref:`Extra info (if enabled) <ecommerce/checkout/extra_step>`
- :ref:`Payment <ecommerce/checkout/payment>`
- :ref:`Order confirmation <ecommerce/checkout/order_confirmation>`

.. _ecommerce/checkout/customize_steps:

Each step can be customized using the website editor by adding :doc:`building blocks
<../website/web_design/building_blocks>` or opening the :guilabel:`Style` tab to enable various
checkout options.

.. note::
   Content added through building blocks is **specific** to each step.

.. tip::
   Restrict access to the :ref:`shop <ecommerce/customer_accounts/shop-access>` and :ref:`checkout
   <ecommerce/customer_accounts/checkout-access>` for specific customers, e.g., in a :doc:`B2B
   <b2b_b2c>` business setup.

.. _ecommerce/checkout/review_order:

Order summary
-------------

The :guilabel:`Order summary` step allows customers to see the items they added to their cart,
adjust quantities, :guilabel:`Remove` products, and :ref:`reorder products from a previous order
<ecommerce/checkout/reorder>`. Information related to the product prices and taxes applied are also
displayed. Customers can then click the :guilabel:`Checkout` button to continue to the :ref:`Address
and delivery <ecommerce/checkout/delivery>` step.

Open the website editor to :ref:`enable <ecommerce/checkout/customize_steps>` checkout options such
as:

- :guilabel:`Suggested Accessories`: to showcase :ref:`accessory products
  <ecommerce/cross_upselling/accessory>`;
- :guilabel:`Promo Code`: to allow customers to redeem :ref:`gift cards <ewallet_gift/gift-cards>`
  or apply :doc:`discount codes <../../sales/sales/products_prices/loyalty_discount>`;
- :guilabel:`Add to Wishlist`: :ref:`Enable wishlists
  <ecommerce/products/additional_features/wishlists>` to allow signed-in users to remove a product
  from their cart and add it to their wishlist using the :guilabel:`Save for later` option.

.. note::
   - If a :doc:`fiscal position <../../finance/accounting/taxes/fiscal_positions>` is detected
     automatically, the product tax is determined based on the customer's IP address.
   - If the installed :doc:`payment provider <../../finance/payment_providers>` supports
     :ref:`express checkout <payment_providers/express_checkout>`, a dedicated button is displayed,
     allowing customers to go straight from the cart to the confirmation page without filling out
     the contact form.

.. _ecommerce/checkout/delivery:

Address and delivery
--------------------

Once they have reviewed their order:

- Unsigned-in customers are prompted to :guilabel:`Sign in` or enter their :guilabel:`Email
  address`, along with their delivery address and phone details;
- Signed-in customers can select the appropriate :guilabel:`Delivery address`.

They can then :doc:`choose a delivery method <shipping>`, select or enter their :guilabel:`Billing
Address` (or toggle the :guilabel:`Same as delivery address` switch if the billing and delivery
addresses are identical), and click :guilabel:`Confirm` to proceed to the next step.

.. tip::
   - For B2B customers, you can also :ref:`enable <ecommerce/checkout/customize_steps>` optional
     :ref:`B2B fields <ecommerce/b2b_b2c/b2b-fields>` in the website editor.
   - You can add a checkbox for users without an account to sign up for a newsletter. To do so, go
     to :menuselection:`Website --> Configuration --> Settings`, scroll down to the
     :guilabel:`eCommerce` section, enable the :guilabel:`Newsletter` feature, and select a
     :guilabel:`Newsletter List`.

.. _ecommerce/checkout/extra_step:

Extra info
----------

You can add an :guilabel:`Extra Info` step in the checkout process to collect additional customer
information through an online form, which is then included in the :ref:`sales order
<handling/sales>`. To do so, :ref:`enable <ecommerce/checkout/customize_steps>` the :guilabel:`Extra
Step` option in the website editor. The form can be :ref:`customized <website/building_blocks/form>`
as needed.

.. _ecommerce/checkout/payment:

Payment
-------

At the :guilabel:`Payment` step, customers can :guilabel:`Choose a payment method`, enter their
payment details, and click :guilabel:`Pay now`.

To make payment methods available to customers, configure and enable one or more :doc:`payment
provider(s) </applications/finance/payment_providers>`. To do so, go to :menuselection:`Website -->
Configuration --> Payment Providers`, :guilabel:`Activate` the relevant payment provider, and
:ref:`configure <payment_providers/add_new>` it.

.. tip::
   The options displayed at checkout depend on the active payment providers, the enabled
   :ref:`payment methods <payment_providers/payment_methods>`, the :ref:`customer’s country and
   currency <payment_providers/currencies_countries>`, and, optionally, the :ref:`maximum amount
   <payment_providers/maximum_amount>` set for the provider.

   To display an :ref:`availability <payment_providers/availability>` report for payment providers
   and payment methods and help diagnose potential availability issues on the payment form, enable
   the :ref:`developer mode <developer-mode>` and click the :icon:`fa-bug` (:guilabel:`bug)` icon.

Terms and conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To require customers to agree to the :doc:`terms and conditions
<../../finance/accounting/customer_invoices/terms_conditions>` before payment, open the website
editor and toggle the :guilabel:`Accept Terms` switch in the :guilabel:`Style` tab.

eWallets and gift cards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Customers can pay with an eWallet or gift card during checkout. To offer these options, go to
:menuselection:`Website --> Configuration --> Settings` and enable :menuselection:`Discounts,
Loyalty & Gift Card` in the :guilabel:`eCommerce` section. Then, go to :menuselection:`Website -->
eCommerce --> Gift cards & eWallet` and :doc:`create a gift card and/or eWallet program
</applications/sales/sales/products_prices/ewallets_giftcards>`.

.. image:: checkout/payments-ewallets-giftcards.png
   :alt: Gift card and eWallet options at checkout

.. _ecommerce/checkout/order_confirmation:

Order confirmation
------------------

The final step of the checkout process is the :guilabel:`Order confirmation`, which provides a
summary of the customer's purchase details. If the :guilabel:`Automatic Invoice` setting has been
activated in the **Sales** app's configuration settings, a sales order and invoice will
automatically be created by Odoo.

.. tip::
   It is possible to configure a website form with a :guilabel:`Create a Customer` :ref:`action
   <website/building_blocks/action>` to automatically create a customer record in the backend when
   filled in.

Access restriction

Google Merchant Center
======================

Google Merchant Center is a tool that allows e-commerce retailers to manage and submit product
data to Google. It serves as a central hub to upload and maintain product details, such as images,
prices, and descriptions so that products can appear across Google's platforms.

.. note::
   Google Merchant Center is only available for physical products and does not support services.

.. tip::
   We recommend using the tool alongside other Google services, such as :doc:`Google Search Console
   <../website/configuration/google_search_console>`, :ref:`Google Analytics
   <analytics/google-analytics>` or :ref:`Google Tag Manager <analytics/google-tag-manager>`
   to obtain detailed reports on product listing issues, improve marketing strategies, increase
   your products' online visibility, and enhance the overall sales performance.

Google Merchant Center setup
============================

To connect your e-commerce with the :abbr:`GMC (Google Merchant Center)` platform, proceed as
follows:

   to skip this step for now.
#. Go to the :guilabel:`Business info` tab in the left menu, and click :guilabel:`Confirm online
   store`.
#. `Verify your website's ownership <https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/11586344?hl=en&visit_id=638883410905570193-1093311043&p=help_11586344&rd=1>`_
   in one of the following ways:

   - Via :ref:`HTML tag <website/google_search_console/HTML-tag>` or :ref:`HTML file
     <GSC-HTML-file-upload>`
   - Via :ref:`Google Tag Manager <analytics/google-tag-manager>`
   - Via :ref:`Google Analytics <analytics/google-analytics>`

   .. tip::

Order handling
==============

When a customer orders on your e-commerce, there are **three** record types required to be handle in
Odoo:

- :ref:`Sales orders <handling/sales>`;
- :ref:`Delivery orders <handling/delivery>`;
- :ref:`Invoices & legal requirements <handling/legal>`.

.. _handling/sales:

Sales orders
============

Order and payment status
------------------------

The first step when a customer adds a product to his cart is the creation of a quotation. Orders can
be managed either from the **Website** or :doc:`Sales </applications/sales/sales>` app. E-commerce
orders can automatically be assigned to a specific sales team by going to :menuselection:`Website
--> Configuration --> Settings`. In the **Shop - Checkout Process** section, select a
:guilabel:`Sales Team` or :guilabel:`Salesperson` to handle e-commerce orders.

.. image:: order_handling/handling-salesteam.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Assignment of online orders to a sales team or salesperson

Orders can be found under :menuselection:`Website --> eCommerce --> Orders/Unpaid Orders`. Each
order goes through a different status:

- **Quotation**: a new product is added to the cart, but the customer has *not* gone through the
  checkout process yet;
- **Quotation sent**: the customer has gone through the checkout process and confirmed the order,
  but the payment is not yet confirmed;
- **Order**: the customer has gone through the checkout process, confirmed the order, and the
  payment is received.

.. image:: order_handling/handling-status.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Statuses of e-commerce orders

Abandoned cart
--------------

An **abandoned cart** represents an order for which the customer did **not finish** the checkout
confirmation process. For these orders, it is possible to send an **email reminder** to the
customer automatically. To enable that feature, go to :menuselection:`Website --> Configuration -->
Settings` and in the :guilabel:`Email & Marketing` section, enable :guilabel:`Automatically send
abandoned checkout emails`. Once enabled, you can set the **time-lapse** after which the email is
sent and customize the **email template** used.

.. note::
   For abandoned cart emails, the customer must either have entered their contact details during the
   checkout process; or be logged-in when they added the product to their cart.

.. _handling/delivery:

Delivery orders
===============

Delivery flow
-------------

Once a quotation has been confirmed, a delivery order is automatically created. The next step is to
process this delivery.

Packing e-commerce orders usually requires picking the product, preparing the packaging, printing the
shipping label(s) and shipping to the customer. Depending on the number of orders, strategy, or
resources, those steps can be considered as one or multiple actions in Odoo.

An automatic email can be sent to the customer when the transfer status in Odoo is “done”. To do so,
enable the feature in the settings of the
:doc:`Inventory </applications/inventory_and_mrp/inventory>` app.

.. note::
   If customers are allowed to pay when picking up their order in stores or by wire transfer, the
   quotation is **not** be confirmed and the stock is **not** be reserved. Orders must be confirmed
   manually to reserve products in stock.

.. seealso::
   - :doc:`../../inventory_and_mrp/inventory/shipping_receiving/setup_configuration/invoicing`
   - :doc:`../../inventory_and_mrp/inventory/shipping_receiving/setup_configuration/labels`
   - :doc:`../../inventory_and_mrp/inventory/shipping_receiving/setup_configuration/multipack`

Returns and refunds
-------------------

Customers can only return an order through an online form. It may not be possible to return products
depending on the return strategy or type of product.

Full refunds can be directly sent to customers from within the order interface. A refund-compatible
payment provider needs to be enabled first.

.. seealso::
   - :doc:`/applications/sales/sales/products_prices/returns`
   - :doc:`/applications/services/helpdesk/advanced/after_sales`
   - :doc:`/applications/finance/payment_providers`

.. _handling/legal:

Invoice and legal requirements
==============================

The final step of an e-commerce order is to generate the invoice and send it to the customer.
Depending on your needs, an invoice can either be generated automatically or on demand of the
customer. This process can be automated if (and when) the online payment is :ref:`confirmed
<handling/sales>`.

To automate invoicing, go to :menuselection:`Website --> Configuration --> Settings` and in the
:guilabel:`Invoicing` section, enable :guilabel:`Automatic Invoice`.


==================================================
SECTION: performance.rst
PATH: applications/websites/ecommerce/performance.rst
==================================================

======================
Performance management
======================

Odoo integrates a variety of tools to analyze and improve the performance of your e-commerce
website.

Data monitoring
===============

**Website** allows monitoring and analysis of the sales performance of your e-commerce. To access
the **reporting view**, go to :menuselection:`Website --> Reporting --> eCommerce`. This dashboard
helps you monitor everything related to sales, such as sales performance per product, category, day,
etc.

.. image:: performance/reporting.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Performance reporting of e-commerce

By clicking :guilabel:`Measures`, you can select the type of measurement used, such as:

- :guilabel:`Margin`;
- :guilabel:`Qty Invoiced`;
- :guilabel:`Untaxed Total`;
- :guilabel:`Volume`;
- ...

Other options include **multiple views (Pivot, etc.), comparison** by periods or years, and directly
:guilabel:`insert in spreadsheet`, etc.

Analytics
=========

It is possible to link your Odoo website with :ref:`analytics/plausible` and
:ref:`analytics/google-analytics`.

.. _ecommerce/performance/email_queue:

Email queue optimization
========================

For websites handling flash sales (e.g., event ticket sales) or experiencing high traffic spikes,
order confirmation emails can become a performance bottleneck, potentially slowing down the checkout
process for other customers.

To improve performance, these emails can be queued and processed separately from the order
confirmation flow. This is managed by the :guilabel:`Sales: Send pending emails` scheduled action,
which sends queued emails as soon as possible.

To enable asynchronous email sending:

#. Enable the :doc:`developer mode </applications/general/developer_mode>`.
#. Go to :menuselection:`Settings --> Technical --> System Parameters` and set the
   :guilabel:`sale.async_emails` system parameter to `True`.
#. Go to :menuselection:`Settings --> Technical --> Scheduled Actions` and ensure that the
   :guilabel:`Sales: Send pending emails` scheduled action is enabled.

.. caution::
   Enabling this feature may delay order confirmation and invoice emails by a few minutes. It is
   recommended only for high-traffic websites, as it can introduce unnecessary delays for e-commerce
   websites with moderate traffic.


==================================================
SECTION: prices.rst
PATH: applications/websites/ecommerce/products/prices.rst
==================================================

======
Prices
======

Odoo offers multiple options to configure prices on the e-commerce. For example, you can apply
:ref:`prices per unit <ecommerce/prices/price-per-unit>`, offer :ref:`discounts
<ecommerce/prices/discounts>`, and set up :ref:`pricelists <ecommerce/prices/pricelists>`.

.. _ecommerce/prices/taxes:

Taxes
=====

To add a tax on a product, you can either set a tax in the :guilabel:`Sales Taxes` field of the
product form or use :doc:`fiscal positions
</applications/finance/accounting/taxes/fiscal_positions>`.

.. seealso::
   - :doc:`/applications/finance/accounting/taxes`
   - :doc:`/applications/finance/accounting/taxes/avatax`

.. _ecommerce-price-management-tax-display:

Choosing the displayed price tax usually depends on a country's regulations or the type of customers
(:doc:`B2B vs. B2C <../b2b_b2c>`). To select the type of price displayed, go to
:menuselection:`Website --> Configuration --> Settings`, select the website, scroll down to the
:guilabel:`eCommerce` section, and under :guilabel:`Display Product Prices` select between:

- :guilabel:`Tax Excluded`: the price displayed on the website is tax-excluded, and the tax is
  computed at the :ref:`order summary <ecommerce/checkout/review_order>` step;
- :guilabel:`Tax Included`: the price displayed on the website is tax-included.

.. note::
   This setting is website-specific and can therefore be configured independently for every
   website in the database.

.. tip::
   - Switch the :ref:`Tax indication <ecommerce/products/product-presentation>` toggle on in the
     website editor to explicitly indicate if the price is `Tax excluded` or `Tax included` on the
     product page.
   - Enable specific :ref:`B2B fields <ecommerce/b2b_b2c/b2b-fields>` in the :ref:`delivery step
     <ecommerce/checkout/delivery>` during the checkout using the :doc:`website editor
     </applications/websites/website/web_design>`.

.. _ecommerce/prices/price-per-unit:

Price per unit
==============

To display a :doc:`price per unit
</applications/inventory_and_mrp/inventory/product_management/configure/uom>` alongside the sales
price on the product page, follow these steps:

#. Go to :menuselection:`Website --> Configuration --> Settings`, scroll to the
   :guilabel:`eCommerce` section, and enable :guilabel:`Product Reference Price`.
#. :ref:`Navigate to the product form <ecommerce/products/create-products>`.
#. Set the product's :guilabel:`Sales Price` and select the unit (e.g., :guilabel:`Units`).
#. In the :guilabel:`Base Unit Count` field, enter the number of units in the product, then
   select the relevant unit from the dropdown list.

.. example::
   Imagine you want to sell a 2-liter bucket of paint for $60, i.e., $30 per liter.

   .. image:: prices/prices-per-unit.png
      :alt: Cost per unit pricing on the product form.

   The price per units, in this case per liter, is shown next to the sales price on the
   product page.

   .. image:: prices/price-cost-per-unit-page.png
      :alt: Unit pricing on the product page.

.. note::
   The price per unit may be mandatory in some countries.

.. seealso::
   :doc:`/applications/inventory_and_mrp/inventory/product_management/configure/uom`

.. _ecommerce/prices/pricelists:

Pricelists
==========

Pricelists in Odoo allow to manage flexible pricing rules and to offer different prices and
discounts based on currencies, time periods, purchase volumes, :ref:`customers' location
<ecommerce/prices/geoip>`, and/or customer type.
To enable pricelists for eCommerce, go to :menuselection:`Website --> Configuration --> Settings`,
scroll down to the :guilabel:`eCommerce` section, enable :guilabel:`Pricelists`, and
:guilabel:`Save`. Then, click :guilabel:`Pricelists` or go to :menuselection:`Website --> eCommerce
--> Pricelists` and :ref:`configure <sales/products/pricelist-configuration>` the relevant
pricelists.

In the :guilabel:`Ecommerce` tab, configure options specific to online sales, such as assigning a
:guilabel:`Website` to a pricelist, allowing customers to :ref:`select it
<ecommerce/prices/selectable-pricelists>`, and/or adding an :ref:`E-commerce Promotional Code
<ecommerce/prices/promotional-code>`.

.. tip::
   - If you are using several websites and you want to use the same pricelist on several of them,
     you need to duplicate the pricelist for each website. If you do not assign any
     website, the pricelist will not be used, unless it is :ref:`selectable
     <ecommerce/prices/selectable-pricelists>`.
   - Pricelists can also be :ref:`assigned to a specific customer
     <sales/products/customer-pricelist-application>`.

.. note::
   - When pricelists are enabled in the Sales app, they are automatically enabled in the eCommerce
     app, and vice versa.
   - In the list of pricelists, order the pricelists by priority: the first takes
     precedence over the second, the second over the third, and so on.
   - It is also possible to create specific pricelists for :ref:`variants
     <products/variants/configure-variants>`.

.. seealso::
   :doc:`/applications/sales/sales/products_prices/prices/pricing`

.. _ecommerce/prices/selectable-pricelists:

Selectable pricelists
---------------------

Selectable pricelists are useful, for example, when selling products in :doc:`multiple currencies
</applications/sales/sales/products_prices/prices/currencies>` and allow customers to
choose a pricelist using the catalog's pricelist selector located next to the :ref:`search bar
<ecommerce/catalog/toolbar-and-filters>`.

.. image:: prices/pricelist-selector.png
   :alt: Pricelist selector on the e-commerce.

To make a pricelist selectable, enable :guilabel:`Selectable`.

.. note::
   - If a pricelist is designated as :guilabel:`Selectable`, and is not assigned to a specific
     website, then the pricelist is selectable on **all** websites.
   - If a pricelist does *not* appear in the selector, it may be due to the following situations:

      - Only one pricelist is defined as :guilabel:`Selectable` and the :ref:`contact has a
        pricelist assigned <sales/products/customer-pricelist-application>`.
      - Multiple selectable pricelists exist, but only those matching the customer's :ref:`country
        group <ecommerce/prices/country-groups>` are shown. It is strongly recommended to disable
        the :guilabel:`Selectable` option when using pricelists with country groups on the
        e-commerce.

.. seealso::
   :ref:`sales/products/currencies/currency-specific-pricelists`

.. _ecommerce/prices/geoip:

GeoIP & country groups
----------------------

It is possible to display a specific pricelist based on the visitor's location and IP address by
assigning :ref:`country groups <ecommerce/prices/country-groups>` to pricelists.

.. _ecommerce/prices/country-groups:

To do so, :ref:`navigate to the relevant pricelist form <ecommerce/prices/pricelists>` and select
the appropriate :guilabel:`Country Groups`. Create or edit as many pricelists for specific regions
as needed. For instance, select :guilabel:`European Union` to apply the pricelist to all EU member
states.

To create a new country group, click :guilabel:`Search more` in the dropdown list, then
:guilabel:`New`. Add a :guilabel:`Group Name` and select the relevant :guilabel:`Countries`.
Use :ref:`Custom filters <search/custom-filters>` if needed.

.. note::
   Each country group must contain at least one country.

.. example::
   Use the following filter if you want to add all non-EU countries to the country group.

   `Country Groups` + `is not equal to` + `European Union`

   .. image:: prices/create-country-group.png
      :alt: Filter for country group creation.

.. important::
   - When using GeoIP to determine the appropriate pricelist, **all** pricelists used on the
     e-commerce must have a country group assigned.
   - It is strongly recommended to disable the :guilabel:`Selectable` option when using pricelists
     with country groups. Indeed, all pricelists with the relevant country group are automatically
     applied to the catalog but if one of them is marked as :ref:`Selectable
     <ecommerce/prices/selectable-pricelists>`, the others will disappear as soon as customers
     select the selectable pricelist.

     .. example::
        Imagine you create three pricelists:

          - `EU regular prices` with the `EU` country group assigned
          - `EU prices with discounts` with the `EU` country group assigned
          - `US prices` with the `US` country group assigned

        If the :guilabel:`Selectable` option is enabled for `EU regular prices` and
        `US prices`, and the customer is from the European Union, only the pricelists
        `EU regular prices` and `EU prices with discounts` will be available. However, since the
        `EU prices with discount` list is not selectable, it will disappear once the customer selects
        the `EU regular prices` list and prices will be displayed based on the `EU regular prices`
        pricelist on the catalog.

Pricelist application
---------------------

On the e-commerce, the *default* pricelist is automatically selected for public, non-logged in users
when no country group is assigned. If :ref:`GeoIP and country groups <ecommerce/prices/geoip>` are
used, public users see the pricelist of their country group by default. :ref:`Logged-in users
<ecommerce/customer_accounts/shop-access>` with
:ref:`assigned pricelists <sales/products/customer-pricelist-application>` see the assigned
pricelist by default **if it is assigned to the website** they are visiting. If not, the website's
default pricelist is applied (i.e., the first available pricelist assigned to the website and
without a country group, following the sequence order).

Assigned pricelists take precedence over country-based pricelists, when applicable, unless the
assigned pricelist is linked to a different country group.

.. example::
   A customer from the United States visits the website. They do not have a portal account. The
   :guilabel:`United States` pricelist is applied.

   A different visitor, also from the United States, has the :guilabel:`Loyal Customer Discount`
   pricelist assigned in their contact form. This assignment takes precedence over the country
   group assignation, so the :guilabel:`Loyal Customer Discount` is applied.

   .. image:: prices/pricelists-example.png
      :alt: An example of various pricelists assigned to a website.


.. _ecommerce/prices/discounts:

Discounts
=========

Discounts programs
------------------

To enable :doc:`discount programs </applications/sales/sales/products_prices/loyalty_discount>`
for your e-commerce, go to :menuselection:`Website --> Configuration --> Settings`, scroll
down to the :guilabel:`eCommerce` section, and enable the :guilabel:`Discounts, Loyalty & Gift
Card` feature.

:ref:`Configure <sales/products/loyalty-programs>` the discount program, make sure the
:guilabel:`Website` option is enabled, and add the relevant :ref:`Pricelist
<ecommerce/prices/pricelists>` and :guilabel:`Website` on the program form, if needed.

.. _ecommerce/prices/permanent-discounts:

Permanent product discount
--------------------------

If the price of a specific product has been permanently reduced, the strikethrough strategy is
commonly used. This involves showing the new discounted price, with the original price crossed out
alongside it.

.. image:: prices/price-strikethrough.png
   :alt: Price strikethrough.

To display a permanently discounted price, navigate to :menuselection:`Website --> Configuration
--> Settings`, scroll down to the :guilabel:`eCommerce`, enable the :guilabel:`Comparison
Price` option, and :guilabel:`Save`. Then, :ref:`go to the product form
<ecommerce/products/create-products>`, enter the new (discounted) price in the
:guilabel:`Sales Price` field and the original one (strikethrough) in the
:guilabel:`Compare to Price` field.

.. note::
   The :guilabel:`Compare to Price` field must contain a price that is higher than the
   :guilabel:`Sales Price` for the original price to appear with a strikethrough.

.. important::
   The :guilabel:`Compare to Price` is not displayed if discounted pricelists apply. If you want to
   use the :guilabel:`Compare to price` with another discount, configure a pricelist with a
   :ref:`promotional code <ecommerce/prices/promotional-code>`.

Discounted pricelists
---------------------

It is also possible to create :ref:`pricelists with discounts <sales/products/price-rules>`.
To do so, :ref:`create a pricelist <sales/products/pricelist-configuration>` and
:ref:`configure the discount <sales/products/price-rules>`.

If a :ref:`pricelist <ecommerce/prices/pricelists>` contains a :ref:`Discount
<sales/products/price-rules>` price type, the price is striked through for applicable customers,
even if the :ref:`Comparison Price <ecommerce/prices/permanent-discounts>` feature has not been
enabled.

.. note::
  If using pricelists with :ref:`country groups <ecommerce/prices/geoip>`, the discounted pricelist
  must be assigned the same country group as the one used for the non-discounted pricelist.

.. _ecommerce/prices/promotional-code:

E-commerce promotional code
---------------------------

To offer a discounted pricelist for customers with a specific discount code, access the relevant
:ref:`pricelist form <ecommerce/prices/pricelists>`, go to the :guilabel:`Ecommerce` tab, and add
an :guilabel:`E-commerce Promotional Code`, e.g., `SUMMERSALE10%`. Then, go to the :guilabel:`Sales
Price` tab, click :guilabel:`Add a line`, and :ref:`configure the discount
<sales/products/price-rules>`. When a customer inserts the code during the :ref:`checkout process
<ecommerce/checkout/review_order>`, this discount is granted according to the :guilabel:`Sales
Price` configuration.

.. note::
   Make sure that the :ref:`Promo Code <ecommerce/checkout/review_order>` option
   in the website editor is enabled and, if using :ref:`country groups
   <ecommerce/prices/country-groups>`, that the discounted pricelist has the same country group
   assigned as the non-discounted pricelist.

.. _ecommerce/prices/hide-prices:

Hide prices
===========

Some businesses, such as :ref:`B2B shops <ecommerce/b2b_b2c/prices>` or companies that sell luxury
or custom items, often prefer to showcase their products online without displaying their prices.

To hide product prices on the e-commerce, go to :menuselection:`Website --> Configuration -->
Settings`, enable :guilabel:`Prevent Sale of Zero Priced Product` in the :guilabel:`eCommerce`
section, and enter a redirect URL in the :guilabel:`Button URL` field. The
:guilabel:`Add to Cart` button on the product page is then replaced by a :guilabel:`Contact us`
button, which can be :ref:`customized <ecommerce/checkout/prevent-sale>` if needed.

After enabling this feature, either set the price to `0` for all desired products or create a
:ref:`pricelist <ecommerce/prices/pricelists>` with all product prices set to `0`. Ensure the
pricelist is assigned to the correct website and is listed first among the website's pricelists.

.. tip::
   - Ensure no pricelist used on the e-commerce has been marked as :guilabel:`Selectable` to prevent
     accidentally displaying the zero-priced pricelist.
   - To hide prices from public visitors while keeping them visible to logged-in customers, create a
     zero-priced pricelist to be used for non-logged-in customers and :ref:`assign
     <sales/products/customer-pricelist-application>` a regular pricelist (with actual prices) to
     customers with :doc:`portal access <../../../general/users/user_portals/portal_access>`.

the product page or in the customer portal
:ref:`after checkout <ecommerce-products-digital-files-after-payment>`.

and click the :guilabel:`Documents` smart button. Then, click :guilabel:`Upload` to upload a file
directly, or for additional options, click :guilabel:`New`, then :guilabel:`Upload your file`.

.. _ecommerce/products/translation:

Translation
===========

If multiple languages are available on your website, you can translate a product's information
directly on the :ref:`product form <ecommerce/products/product-form>`. Fields that support multiple
languages are identifiable by their abbreviation language (e.g., EN) next to their field.

The e-commerce-related fields to translate are:

- :guilabel:`Product name`.
- :guilabel:`Out-of-Stock Message` (under the :guilabel:`Sales` tab).
- :guilabel:`Sales Description` (under the :guilabel:`Sales` tab).

.. note::
   - Having untranslated content on a web page may be detrimental to the user experience and
     :doc:`SEO <../../websites/website/structure/seo>`. You can use the
     :doc:`Translate <../website/configuration/translate>` feature to translate the page's content.
   - To check the language(s) of your website, go to :menuselection:`Website --> Configuration -->
     Settings` and go to the :guilabel:`Website Info` section.

.. _ecommerce/products/website-availability:

Website availability
--------------------

To set the product's website availability, navigate to the :ref:`product form
<ecommerce/products/product-form>`, go to the :guilabel:`Sales` tab, and in the
:guilabel:`eCommerce shop` section, select the :guilabel:`Website` you wish the product to be
available on. Leave the field blank to make the product available on *all* websites.

.. note::
   - You can make a product available on either *one* website or *all* websites, but selecting only
     *some* websites is not possible. To sell the product on multiple specific websites without
     making it available on all, **duplicate** the product for each website and assign the
     corresponding website to each duplicate.
   - Enable the :guilabel:`Is Published` toggle to make sure the product is available for website
     visitors.

.. _ecommerce/products/stock-management:

Stock management
================

To enable and configure inventory management options, go to :menuselection:`Website -->
Configuration --> Settings`, scroll down to the :guilabel:`Shop - Products` section and the
:guilabel:`Inventory Defaults` sub-section.

.. important::
   - The **Inventory** app must be installed to see the inventory management options.
   - To display the stock level on the product page, the :guilabel:`Product Type` field must be set
     to :guilabel:`Storable` in the :ref:`product form <ecommerce/products/product-form>`.

.. tip::
   If a unique reference is needed for inventory management, install the :doc:`Manufacturing app
   </applications/inventory_and_mrp/manufacturing>`, and create :doc:`Kit bills of materials
   </applications/inventory_and_mrp/manufacturing/advanced_configuration/kit_shipping>`. Each
   kit links its published "virtual" products to the main reference tracked in Inventory. This
   ensures that any item sold on the website is converted into the corresponding stocked item in
   the delivery order.

Inventory
---------

In the :guilabel:`Inventory Defaults` sub-section, fill in those fields:

- :doc:`Warehouse <../../inventory_and_mrp/inventory/warehouses_storage/inventory_management/warehouses>`.
- :guilabel:`Out-of-Stock`: Enable :guilabel:`Continue Selling` to allow customers to place orders
  even when the product is **out of stock**. Leave the box unchecked to **prevent orders**.
- :guilabel:`Show Available Qty`: Displays the available quantity left under a specified threshold
  on the product page. The available quantity is calculated based on the :guilabel:`On hand`
  quantity minus the quantity already reserved for outgoing transfers.

==================================================

========
Delivery
========

Odoo eCommerce allows you to configure various delivery methods, enabling customers to choose
their preferred option at :doc:`checkout <checkout>`. These methods include :ref:`external providers
<ecommerce/shipping/external-provider>`, :ref:`custom options <ecommerce/shipping/custom-method>`
such as flat-rate or free shipping, local carriers via
:doc:`Sendcloud </applications/inventory_and_mrp/inventory/shipping_receiving/setup_configuration/sendcloud_shipping>`
or :ref:`Based on Rules <inventory/shipping/rules>`, and
:ref:`in-store pickup <ecommerce/shipping/instore-pickup>`.

.. _ecommerce/shipping/external-provider:

External provider integration
=============================

To handle product delivery, you can connect your database to :doc:`third-party shipping carriers
</applications/inventory_and_mrp/inventory/shipping_receiving/setup_configuration/third_party_shipper>`
like :doc:`FedEx </applications/inventory_and_mrp/inventory/shipping_receiving/setup_configuration/fedex>`,
:doc:`UPS </applications/inventory_and_mrp/inventory/shipping_receiving/setup_configuration/ups_credentials>`,
or :doc:`DHL </applications/inventory_and_mrp/inventory/shipping_receiving/setup_configuration/dhl_credentials>`.
A shipping connector links to these providers, automating :doc:`tracking labels
</applications/inventory_and_mrp/inventory/shipping_receiving/setup_configuration/labels>` and shipping
processes.

To enable a third-party delivery provider, go to :menuselection:`Website --> Configuration -->
Settings`, scroll to the :guilabel:`Delivery` section, select the desired delivery provider(s),
and :guilabel:`Save`.

Go to :menuselection:`Website --> Configuration --> Delivery Methods` and select the delivery method
in the list to :ref:`configure it <inventory/shipping_receiving/configure-delivery-method>`.

.. seealso::
   - :doc:`Third-party shipping carriers
     </applications/inventory_and_mrp/inventory/shipping_receiving/setup_configuration/third_party_shipper>`
   - :doc:`Gelato </applications/sales/sales/gelato>`

.. important::
   The field used to define additional fees **must** be filled **in your third-party delivery
   provider account**, even if you do not plan to charge customers any additional fee. If you do not
   want to apply a fee, enter `0`. If the field is left empty, the delivery price cannot be
   calculated, and an error message prompts the customer to select an alternative delivery method.

Margin on delivery rate
-----------------------

To add an additional fee to the base shipping rate (e.g., to cover extra costs), log into your
carrier account and set the desired fee in the related field. The shipping connector retrieves this
fee and includes it in the final price at checkout. Contact your carrier for further assistance
with this configuration.

Alternatively, enter `0` in your third-party shipping provider account, then set the fee in Odoo.
To do so, access the desired :ref:`shipping method's form
<inventory/shipping_receiving/configure-delivery-method>` and enter the fee in the :guilabel:`Margin
on Rate` field to add a percentage to the shipping costs and/or the :guilabel:`Additional margin`
field to add a fixed amount.

.. important::
   The field used to define additional fees cannot be left empty in your third-party shipping
   provider account.

.. _ecommerce/shipping/custom-method:

Custom delivery method
======================

Custom delivery methods must be created, for example:

- to integrate delivery carriers through :doc:`Sendcloud
  </applications/inventory_and_mrp/inventory/shipping_receiving/setup_configuration/sendcloud_shipping>`;
- to configure specific rules (e.g., to offer free shipping for orders above a specific amount) for
  a specific provider;
- to configure :ref:`Fixed Price <inventory/shipping/fixed>` shipping, or shipping :ref:`Based on
  Rules <inventory/shipping/rules>`.

To create a custom delivery method, go to :menuselection:`Website --> Configuration --> Delivery
Methods`, click :guilabel:`New`, and fill in the :ref:`fields
<inventory/shipping_receiving/shipping-methods-details>`.

In the :guilabel:`Provider` field, select :ref:`Based on Rules <inventory/shipping/rules>` or
:ref:`Fixed Price <inventory/shipping/fixed>`.

.. tip::
   Upon :ref:`configuring <inventory/shipping_receiving/configure-delivery-method>` a delivery
   method, you can:

   - Restrict it :doc:`to a specific website <../website/configuration/multi_website>` by
     selecting it in the :guilabel:`Website` field.
   - Click the :guilabel:`Test Environment` smart button to switch to the
     :guilabel:`Production Environment`. Then, click :guilabel:`Unpublished` to :guilabel:`Publish`
     the delivery method and make it available to website visitors.
   - Use the :guilabel:`Availability` tab to define :ref:`conditions
     <inventory/shipping_receiving/availability>` for the delivery method based on the order's
     content or destination.

.. _ecommerce/shipping/instore-pickup:

Click & Collect
===============

To allow customers to reserve products online and collect them in-store, follow these steps:

#. Go to :menuselection:`Website --> Configuration --> Settings`.
#. Scroll to the :guilabel:`eCommerce` section, enable :guilabel:`Click & Collect`, and
   :guilabel:`Save`.
#. Click :icon:`fa-arrow-right` :guilabel:`Configure Pickup Locations` to :ref:`configure
   <inventory/shipping_receiving/configure-delivery-method>` the delivery method if needed and
   ensure the :guilabel:`Provider` field is set to :guilabel:`Pick up in store`.
#. In the :guilabel:`Stores` tab, click :guilabel:`Add a line` and select the warehouse(s) where
   customers can collect their orders.
#. Once your setup is complete, click the :guilabel:`Unpublish` button to change the status to
   :guilabel:`Publish` and make the delivery method available to customers.

.. note::
   - When the product is in stock, a location selector is displayed on the :doc:`product
     <products>` and :doc:`checkout <checkout>` pages. Customers cannot select a pickup location
     if the product is out of stock at that location, unless the :ref:`Continue selling
     <ecommerce/products/stock-management>` option for out-of-stock products is enabled.
   - If the :ref:`Show Available Qty <ecommerce/products/stock-management>` option is enabled for a
     product, customers can view the stock quantity available for each warehouse in the location
     selector on the product page.
   - Each warehouse must have a **complete address** to ensure its location is accurately displayed
     to customers. Incomplete addresses prevent the warehouse from being shown.
   - The :guilabel:`Click & Collect` option is not available for services.
   - By default, the :ref:`Pay on Site <payment_providers/inperson_payments/pay_on_site>` payment
     method is :ref:`enabled and published <payment_providers/add_new>` when the :guilabel:`Click &
     Collect` feature is activated.

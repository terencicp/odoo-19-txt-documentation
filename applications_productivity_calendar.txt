Calendar
========

Odoo **Calendar** is a scheduling app that allows users to integrate a company's business flow into
a single management platform. By integrating with the other apps in Odoo's ecosystem, **Calendar**
allows users to schedule and organize meetings, schedule events, plan employee appraisals,
coordinate projects, and more – all from the same platform.

Upon opening the :menuselection:`Calendar app`, users have an overview of their current meetings.
The selected view option appears as a :guilabel:`Day`, :guilabel:`Week`, :guilabel:`Month`, or
:guilabel:`Year` drop-down menu. Under the view options drop-down menu, users can also enable or
disable :guilabel:`Show weekends`.

.. image:: calendar/calendar-overview.png
   :alt: Overview of Calendar app.

.. tip::
   Depending on the selected view option, users can click the :icon:`oi-arrow-left`
   :icon:`oi-arrow-right` :guilabel:`(left or right arrow)` buttons to switch between days, weeks,
   etc., and switch back to the current day with the :guilabel:`Today` button.

Sync third-party calendars
--------------------------

Users can sync Odoo with existing :doc:`Outlook <calendar/outlook>` and/or
:doc:`Google <calendar/google>` calendars, by heading to
:menuselection:`Calendar app --> Configuration --> Settings`. From here, enter
:guilabel:`Client ID` and :guilabel:`Client Secret`. There is also an option to pause
synchronization by ticking the checkbox, or automating synchronization by keeping it blank.

Once the desired configurations are complete, be sure to click :guilabel:`Save` before moving on.

Events created in synced calendars automatically appear across the integrated platforms.

.. seealso::
   - :doc:`Synchronize Outlook calendar with Odoo <calendar/outlook>`
   - :doc:`Synchronize Google calendar with Odoo <calendar/google>`

Create activities from chatter
------------------------------

Instantly create new meetings anywhere in Odoo through an individual record's chatter, like
in a **CRM** opportunity card or task in the **Projects** app.

From the chatter, click on the :guilabel:`Activities` button. In the :guilabel:`Schedule Activity`
pop-up window, select the desired :guilabel:`Activity Type`, which populates a set of buttons,
depending on the activity.

Activities that involve other schedules, like :guilabel:`Meeting` or :guilabel:`Call for Demo`, link
to the **Calendar** app. Select one of these activities to link to the **Calendar** app, then hit
:guilabel:`Open Calendar` to navigate back to the app. Alternatively, it is also possible to
:guilabel:`Schedule & Mark as Done` to close out the activity, or select :guilabel:`Done & Schedule
Next` to keep the :guilabel:`Schedule Activity` window open to create another.

.. seealso::
   :doc:`Schedule activities in Odoo <../essentials/activities>`

Plan an event
-------------

To put an event on the calendar, open the :menuselection:`Calendar app`, and click into the target
date. On the :guilabel:`New Event` pop-up window that appears, start by adding the event title.

   :alt: Schedule an event window on Calendar app.

The target date auto-populates in the :guilabel:`Start` field. This can be changed by clicking
into the date section, and selecting a date from the calendar. For multi-day events, select the end
date in the second field, then click :guilabel:`Apply`.

Tick the :guilabel:`All Day` checkbox if there is no specific start or end time.

For events with specific start and stop times, ensure the :guilabel:`All Day` checkbox is unticked
to enable time selection. With the :guilabel:`All Day` checkbox unticked, time selections appear in
the :guilabel:`Start` field.

The signed-in user auto-populates as the first attendee. Additional :guilabel:`Attendees` can be
added or created from here, as well.

For virtual meetings, copy and paste the URL into the space provided in the
:guilabel:`Videocall URL` field. Or, click :icon:`fa-plus` :guilabel:`Odoo meeting` to create a
link.

Next, either create the event by clicking :guilabel:`Save & Close`, or select :guilabel:`More
Options` to further configure the event.

.. tip::
   Once the event is created, users can click into the virtual meeting directly from the calendar
   event to access more configuration options.

===============================
Google Calendar synchronization
===============================

Synchronize Google Calendar with Odoo to see and manage meetings from both platforms (updates go in
both directions). This integration helps organize schedules, so a meeting is never missed.

.. seealso::
   - :doc:`/applications/general/users/google`
   - :doc:`/applications/general/email_communication/google_oauth`

Setup in Google
===============

Select (or create) a project
----------------------------

Create a new Google API project and enable the Google Calendar API. First, go to the `Google API
Console <https://console.developers.google.com>`_ and log into the Google account.

.. note::
   If this is the first time visiting this page, Google will prompt the user to enter a country and
   agree to the Terms of Service. Select a country from the drop-down list and agree to the
   :abbr:`ToS (Terms of Service)`.

Next, click :guilabel:`Select a project` and select (or create) an API project to configure OAuth
in, and store credentials. Click :guilabel:`New Project`.

.. image:: google/new-api-project.png
   :alt: Create a new API project to store credentials.

Give the API project a clear name, like `Odoo Sync`, so it can be identified. Then click the
:guilabel:`Create` button.

Enable Google calendar API
--------------------------

Now, click on :guilabel:`Enabled APIs and Services` in the left menu. Select :guilabel:`Enabled APIs
and Services` again if the :guilabel:`Search bar` does not appear.

.. image:: google/enable-apis-services.png
   :alt: Enable APIs and Services on the API Project.

After that, search for `Google Calendar API` using the search bar and select :guilabel:`Google
Calendar API` from the search results. Click :guilabel:`Enable`.

.. image:: google/enable-google-cal-api.png
   :alt: Enable the Google Calendar API.

OAuth consent screen
--------------------

Now that the API project has been created, OAuth should be configured. To do that, click on
:guilabel:`OAuth consent screen` in the left menu, then click the :guilabel:`Get started` button.

.. warning::
   *Personal* Gmail Accounts are only allowed to be **External** User Type, which means Google may
   require an approval, or for *Scopes* to be added on. However, using a *Google WorkSpace* account
   allows for **Internal** User Type to be used.

   Note, as well, that while the API connection is in the *External* testing mode, then no approval
   is necessary from Google. User limits in this testing mode is set to 100 users.

Follow the proceeding steps, in order:

#. In :guilabel:`App Information`, type `Odoo` in the :guilabel:`App name` field, then enter the
   email address for the :guilabel:`User support email` field and click the :guilabel:`Next` button.
#. In :guilabel:`Audience`, select :guilabel:`External`, then click the :guilabel:`Next` button.
#. In :guilabel:`Contact Information`, enter the email again, then click the :guilabel:`Next`
   button.
#. In :guilabel:`Finish`, tick the checkbox to agree to :guilabel:`Google API Services: User
   Policy.` For the last step, click the :guilabel:`Create` button.

Authorized domain setup
-----------------------

Next, any domains set to appear on the consent screen or in an OAuth client's configuration must be
pre-registered. To do so, navigate to :guilabel:`Branding` in the left menu. In the
:guilabel:`Authorized domains` section, click the :guilabel:`Add domain` button to create a field to
enter an authorized domain. Enter a domain, such as `odoo.com`, then click the :guilabel:`Save`
button at the bottom of the page.

Test users
----------

To give users the ability to sync with personal Gmail accounts, they must be set as a test user.
Setup test users by going to :guilabel:`Audience` in the left-side menu and clicking the
:guilabel:`Add users` button in the :guilabel:`Test users` section. Enter any desired user emails,
and click the :guilabel:`Save` button.

Create credentials
------------------

The *Client ID* and the *Client Secret* are both needed to connect Google Calendar to Odoo. This is
the last step in the Google console. Begin by clicking :guilabel:`Clients` in the left menu.
Then, click :guilabel:`Create Credentials`, and select :guilabel:`OAuth client ID`, Google will open
a guide to create credentials.

Under :menuselection:`Create OAuth Client ID`, select :guilabel:`Website application` for the
:guilabel:`Application Type` field, and type `My Odoo Database` for the :guilabel:`Name`.

- Under the :guilabel:`Authorized JavaScript Origins` section, click :guilabel:`+ Add URI` and type
  the company's Odoo full :abbr:`URL (Uniform Resource Locator)` address.
- Under the :guilabel:`Authorized redirect URIs` section, click :guilabel:`+ Add URI` and type the
  company's Odoo :abbr:`URL (Uniform Resource Locator)` address followed by
  `/google_account/authentication`. Finally, click :guilabel:`Create`.

.. image:: google/uri.png
   :alt: Add the authorized JavaScript origins and the authorized redirect URIs.

A :guilabel:`Client ID` and :guilabel:`Client Secret` will appear, save these somewhere safe.

Setup in Odoo
=============

Once the *Client ID* and the *Client Secret* are located, open the Odoo database and go to
:menuselection:`Settings --> Calendar` to find the :guilabel:`Google Calendar` feature. Tick the
checkbox labeled :guilabel:`Google Calendar`.

.. image:: google/settings-google-cal.png
   :alt: The Google Calendar checkbox in General Settings.

Next, copy and paste the *Client ID* and the *Client Secret* from the Google Calendar API
credentials page into their respective fields below the :guilabel:`Google Calendar` checkbox. Then,
click :guilabel:`Save`.

.. note::
   Tick the :guilabel:`Pause Synchronization` checkbox to temporarily pause events from being
   updated. This allows for testing and troubleshooting without removing credentials or uninstalling
   the synchronization. To resume the sync, clear the checkbox and save.

Sync calendar in Odoo
=====================

Finally, open the :menuselection:`Calendar` app in Odoo and click on the :guilabel:`Google` sync
button to sync Google Calendar with Odoo.

.. image:: google/sync-google.png
   :alt: Click the Google sync button in Odoo Calendar to sync Google Calendar with Odoo.

.. note::
   When syncing Google Calendar with Odoo for the first time, the page will redirect to the Google
   Account. From there, select the :guilabel:`Email Account` that should have access, then select
   :guilabel:`Continue` (should the app be unverified), and finally select :guilabel:`Continue` (to
   give permission for the transfer of data).

.. image:: google/trust-odoo.png
   :alt: Give Odoo permission to access Google Calendar.

Now, Odoo Calendar is successfully synced with Google Calendar!

.. warning::
   Odoo highly recommends testing the Google calendar synchronization on a test database and a test
   email address (that is not used for any other purpose) before attempting to sync the desired
   Google Calendar with the user's production database.

   Once a user synchronizes their Google calendar with the Odoo calendar:

   - Creating an event in Odoo causes Google to send an invitation to all event attendees.
   - Deleting an event in Odoo causes Google to send a cancellation to all event attendees.
   - Adding a contact to an event causes Google to send an invitation to all event attendees.
   - Removing a contact from an event causes Google to send a cancellation to all event attendees.

   Events can be created in *Google Calendar* without sending a notification by selecting
   :guilabel:`Don't Send` when prompted to send invitation emails.

Troubleshoot sync
=================

There may be times when the *Google Calendar* account does not sync correctly with Odoo. Sync issues
can be seen in the database logs.

In these cases, the account needs troubleshooting. A reset can be performed using the
:guilabel:`Reset Account` button, which can be accessed by navigating to :menuselection:`Settings
app --> Manage Users`. Then, select the user to modify the calendar, and click the
:guilabel:`Calendar` tab.

.. image:: google/google-reset.png
   :alt: Reset buttons highlighted on the calendar tab of the user.

Next, click :guilabel:`Reset Account` under the correct calendar.

Reset options
-------------

The following reset options are available for troubleshooting Google calendar sync with Odoo:

.. image:: google/reset-calendar.png
   :alt: Google calendar reset options in Odoo.

:guilabel:`User's Existing Events`:

 - :guilabel:`Leave them untouched`: no changes to the events.
 - :guilabel:`Delete from the current Google Calendar account`: delete the events from *Google
   Calendar*.
 - :guilabel:`Delete from Odoo`: delete the events from the Odoo calendar.
 - :guilabel:`Delete from both`: delete the events from both *Google Calendar* and Odoo calendar.

:guilabel:`Next Synchronization`:

 - :guilabel:`Synchronize only new events`: sync new events on *Google Calendar* and/or Odoo
   calendar.
 - :guilabel:`Synchronize all existing events`: sync all events on *Google Calendar* and/or Odoo
   calendar.

Click :guilabel:`Confirm` after making the selection to modify the user's events and the calendar
synchronization.

Google OAuth FAQ
================

At times there can be configuration errors that occur, and troubleshooting is needed to resolve the
issue. Below are the most common errors that may occur when configuring the *Google Calendar* for
use with Odoo.

Production vs. testing publishing status
----------------------------------------

Choosing :guilabel:`Production` as the :guilabel:`Publishing Status` (instead of
:guilabel:`Testing`) displays the following warning message:

`OAuth is limited to 100 sensitive scope logins until the OAuth consent screen is verified. This may
require a verification process that can take several days.`

To correct this warning, navigate to the `Google API Platform
<https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent>`_. If the :guilabel:`Publishing Status`
is :guilabel:`In Production`, click :guilabel:`Back to Testing` to correct the issue.

No test users added
-------------------

If no test users are added to the :guilabel:`OAuth consent screen`, then an :guilabel:`Error 403:
access_denied` populates.

.. image:: google/403-error.png
   :alt: 403 Access Denied Error.

To correct this error, return to the :guilabel:`OAuth consent screen`, under :guilabel:`APIs &
Services`, and add test users to the app. Add the email to be configured in Odoo.

Application Type
----------------

When creating the credentials (OAuth *Client ID* and *Client Secret*), if :guilabel:`Desktop App` is
selected for the :guilabel:`Application Type`, an :guilabel:`Authorization Error` appears
(:guilabel:`Error 400:redirect_uri_mismatch`).

.. image:: google/error-400.png
   :alt: Error 400 Redirect URI Mismatch.

To correct this error, delete the existing credentials, and create new credentials, by selecting
:guilabel:`Web Application` for the :guilabel:`Application Type`.

Then, under :guilabel:`Authorized redirect URIs`, click :guilabel:`ADD URI`, and type:
`https://yourdbname.odoo.com/google_account/authentication` in the field, being sure to replace
*yourdbname* in the URL with the **real** Odoo database name.

.. tip::
   Ensure that the domain (used in the URI:
   `https://yourdbname.odoo.com/google_account/authentication`) is the exact same domain as
   configured in the `web.base.url` system parameter.

   Access the `web.base.url` by activating :ref:`developer mode <developer-mode>`, and navigating to
   :menuselection:`Settings app --> Technical header menu --> Parameters section --> System
   Parameters`.


==================================================
SECTION: outlook.rst
PATH: applications/productivity/calendar/outlook.rst

Outlook Calendar synchronization
================================

Synchronizing a user's *Outlook Calendar* with Odoo is useful for keeping track of tasks and
appointments across all related applications.

.. seealso::
   - :doc:`../../general/users/azure`
   - :doc:`../../general/email_communication/azure_oauth`

Microsoft Azure setup
=====================

To sync the *Outlook Calendar* with Odoo's *Calendar*, a Microsoft *Azure* account is required.
Creating an account is free for users who have never tried, or paid for, *Azure*. For more
information, view the account options on the `Azure website
<https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F>`_.

Refer to `Microsoft's documentation <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/
develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant>`_ on how to set up a Microsoft *Entra ID* (formally called
Microsoft *Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)*). This is an API console to manage and register
Microsoft applications.

Existing Microsoft *Entra ID* users should log in at the `Microsoft Azure developer portal
<https://portal.azure.com/#home>`_. Next, select :guilabel:`View` under the section labeled
:guilabel:`Manage Microsoft Entra ID`.

Register application
--------------------

After logging in with the Microsoft *Entra ID*, `register an application
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app>`_.

To create an application, click :guilabel:`+ Add` in the top menu. From the resulting drop-down
menu, select :guilabel:`App Registration`.

.. image:: outlook/app-register.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Microsoft Azure management page with + Add and App Registration menu highlighted.

Enter a unique :guilabel:`Name` for the connected application.

Choosing the appropriate :guilabel:`Supported account type` is essential, or else the connected
application will not work. Users who wish to connect their *Outlook Calendar* to Odoo should select
the :guilabel:`Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Microsoft Entra ID directory -
Multitenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox)` option for :guilabel:`Supported
account types`.

When configuring the :guilabel:`Redirect URI`, choose the :guilabel:`Web` option from the first
drop-down menu. Then, enter the Odoo database URI (URL) followed by
`/microsoft_account/authentication`.

.. example::
   Enter `https://yourdbname.odoo.com/microsoft_account/authentication` for the :guilabel:`Redirect
   URI`. Replace `yourdbname.odoo.com` with the :abbr:`URL (Uniform Resource Locator)`.

.. tip::
   Ensure the database's :abbr:`URL (Uniform Resource Locator)` (domain) used in the URI is the
   exact same domain as the one configured on the `web.base.url` system parameter.

   Access the `web.base.url` by activating :ref:`developer mode <developer-mode>`, and navigating to
   :menuselection:`Settings app --> Technical header menu --> Parameters section --> System
   Parameters`. Then, select it from the :guilabel:`Key` list on the :guilabel:`System Parameters`
   page.

.. image:: outlook/azure-register-application.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The "Supported account type" and "Redirect URI" settings in the Microsoft Entra ID portal.

For more information on the restrictions and limitations of URIs, check Microsoft's `Redirect URI
(reply URL) restrictions and limitations
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/reply-url>`_ page.

Finally, on the application registration page, click :guilabel:`Register` button to complete the
application registration. The :guilabel:`Application (client) ID` is produced. Copy this value, as
it is needed later, in the :ref:`outlook_calendar/odoo_setup`.

.. image:: outlook/app-client-id.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Application client ID highlighted in the essentials section of the newly created
         application.

Create client secret
--------------------

The second credential needed to complete the synchronization of the Microsoft *Outlook Calendar* is
the *Client Secret*. The user **must** add a client secret, as this allows Odoo to authenticate
itself, requiring no interaction from the user's side. *Certificates* are optional.

To add a client secret, click :menuselection:`Certificates & secrets` in the left menu. Then click
:guilabel:`+ New client secret` to create the client secret.

.. image:: outlook/client-secret.png
   :align: center
   :alt: New client secret page with certificates and secrets menu and new client secret option
         highlighted.

Next, type a :guilabel:`Description`, and select when the client secret :guilabel:`Expires`.
Available options include: :guilabel:`90 days (3 months)`, :guilabel:`365 days (12 months)`,
:guilabel:`545 days (18 months)`, :guilabel:`730 days (24 months)` or :guilabel:`Custom`. The
:guilabel:`Custom` option allows the administrator to set a :guilabel:`Start` and :guilabel:`End`
date.

Finally, click :guilabel:`Add` to :guilabel:`Add a client secret`.

.. tip::
   Since resetting the synchronization can be tricky, Odoo recommends setting the maximum allowed
   expiration date for the client secret (24 months or custom), so there is no need to
   re-synchronize soon.

Copy the :guilabel:`Value` for use in the next section.

.. warning::
   Client secret values cannot be viewed, except immediately after creation. Be sure to save the
   secret when created *before* leaving the page.

.. _outlook/sync:

Sync with Outlook
=================

.. warning::

   Odoo highly recommends testing the Outlook calendar synchronization on a test database and a
   test email address (that is not used for any other purpose) before attempting to sync the
   desired Outlook Calendar with the user's production database.

   If the user has any past, present, or future events on their Odoo calendar before syncing their
   Outlook calendar, Outlook will treat the events pulled from Odoo's calendar during the sync as
   new events, causing an email notification to be sent from Outlook to all the event attendees.

   To avoid unwanted emails being sent to all past, present, and future event attendees, the user
   must add the events from the Odoo calendar to the Outlook calendar before the first ever sync,
   delete the events from Odoo, and then start the sync.

   Even after synchronizing the Odoo Calendar with the Outlook calendar, Outlook will still send a
   notification to all event participants every time an event is edited (created, deleted,
   unarchived, or event date/time changed), with no exceptions. This is a limitation that cannot be
   fixed from Odoo's side.

   In summary, once a user synchronizes their Outlook calendar with the Odoo calendar:

   - Creating an event in Odoo causes Outlook to send an invitation to all event attendees.
   - Deleting an event in Odoo causes Outlook to send a cancellation to all event attendees.
   - Unarchiving an event in Odoo causes Outlook to send an invitation to all event attendees.
   - Archiving an event in Odoo causes Outlook to send a cancellation to all event attendees.
   - Adding a contact to an event causes Outlook to send an invitation to all event attendees.
   - Removing a contact from an event causes Outlook to send a cancellation to all event attendees.

Sync Odoo Calendar and Outlook
------------------------------

In the Odoo database, open to the *Calendar* module, and click the :guilabel:`Outlook` sync button
on the right-side of the page, beneath the monthly calendar.

.. image:: outlook/outlook-sync-button.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The "Outlook" sync button in Odoo Calendar.

The synchronization is a two-way process, meaning that events are reconciled in both accounts
(*Outlook* and Odoo). The page redirects to a Microsoft login page, and the user is asked to log in
to their account, if they are not already. Finally, grant the required permissions by clicking
:guilabel:`Accept`.

.. note::
   All users that want to use the synchronization simply need to :ref:`sync their calendar with
   Outlook <outlook/sync>`. The configuration of Microsoft's *Azure* account is only done once, as
   Microsoft *Entra ID* tenants' client IDs and client secrets are unique, and help the user manage
   a specific instance of Microsoft cloud services for internal and external users.

Troubleshoot sync
=================

There may be times when the *Microsoft Outlook Calendar* account does not sync correctly with Odoo.
Sync issues can be seen in the database logs.

In these cases, the account needs troubleshooting. A reset can be performed using the
:guilabel:`Reset Account` button, which can be accessed by navigating to :menuselection:`Settings
app --> Manage Users`. Then, select the user to modify the calendar, and click on the
:guilabel:`Calendar` tab.

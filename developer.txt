    external id
    external identifier
    external identifiers
        string identifier stored in ``ir.model.data``, can be used to refer
        to a record regardless of its database identifier during data imports
        or export/import roundtrips.

        External identifiers are in the form :samp:`{module}.{id}` (e.g.
        ``account.invoice_graph``). From within a module, the
        :samp:`{module}.` prefix can be left out.

        Sometimes referred to as "xml id" or ``xml_id`` as XML-based
        :ref:`reference/data` make extensive use of them.

    format string
        inspired by `jinja variables`_, format strings allow more easily
        mixing literal content and computed content (expressions): content
        between ``{{`` and ``}}`` is interpreted as an expression and
        evaluated, other content is interpreted as literal strings and
        displayed as-is

    GIS
    Geographic Information System
        any computer system or subsystem to capture, store, manipulate,
        analyze, manage or present spatial and geographical data.

    minified
    minification
        process of removing extraneous/non-necessary sections of files
        (comments, whitespace) and possibly recompiling them using equivalent
        but shorter structures (`ternary operator`_ instead of ``if/else``) in
        order to reduce network traffic
